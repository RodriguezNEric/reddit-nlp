I’m 22. Parents divorced ever since i can remember. Sister is 24, married, 7m pregnant and living in AZ. I live with my mom in FL. Dad is in NC. I have an ok relationship with my dad. No issues. But we only talk once every month or so. My mom is extremely emotionally abusive. She never really was the physically affectionate mother and has even told me she doesn’t say “i love you” back because she says i dont know what love is and that she won’t say it back because “the love isn’t there”

Now. I have a boyfriend. And he has supported me in every way i could’ve imagined. I have so much love for him. When i see him. Like when i stare in his eyes. It makes me want to cry and i do some days. Is that normal? Or why do i feel like this? I feel bad for crying because it worries him because he thinks I’m not okay. Thank you for any help.

I usually talk to myself (and Im pretty sure most people do). However more recently at night especially, I get into my thoughts and mostly they're about my past traumas where people who hurt me psychologically got away with it since I was really young and didnt know shit. It's also something I can never share to anyone since I'll just end up crying and it's tricky. 

Anyway so my young adult brain now keeps reminding me of the trauma (when I was younger my brain would actually forget about it, as in it would only be reminded to me if someone asked me specific questions related to the experiences). 

So what's the actual problem?

I get into these scenarios (i act out lol) where I confront them and expose them to everyone and I would be driven by my anger. However, it's VERY quiet; it's night everyone is sleeping and I can't just scream. BUT im lying on my bed with me clenching and angrily whispering (in my head I'm raising my voice). It gets to a point where the emotions heighten due to anger and I start crying. It almost feels like I'm in a movie acting in an emotional but hypothetical scene, except my anger is real but obviously suppressed.

So i look up what this is. Ive briefly read about IED, BPD, and even schizophrenia or smt but I don't think these ""attacks"" fit their description. IED was closest one but I can actually control myself better now to avoid breaking things, especially when these attacks are at night or when Im all alone. I can go and have been explosive before but it's usually after being provoked and deeply hurt rather than being ticked off by something petty. I dont like trouble so usually im just quiet when I'm angry and sometimes hit myself instead. BPD is also possible for my other problems but i think it's not that related to these specific rage attacks that im talking about.

I know I shouldnt be self diagnosing but I was really confused cuz Im more aware of me acting more insane lately lol so I'm pretty sure I can rule out schiz. And yes I am aware its all pretend and am not delusional. Also connecting to therapy is tricky at the moment with my schedule and I live far now from my family doctor, so I'm trying my best to understand potential problems so later I can discuss with mental health professionals hopefully after this whole covid thing.



Again Im not looking for diagnosis, just wondering if anyone has gone through this specifically and if there are potential issues that exactly describe it",mentalhealth,2021-01-20 06:55:53

A scene from a TV show made me uncomfortable but nothing especially terrible because its entirely fictional. It confused the fk out of me when I identified feelings of real-life reoccurring pain from thinking about this fictional event. I watched the entire show, hoping that it would redeem what happened, and being a fan was almost a defence mechanism for coping with that feeling. When I gave up that show, the same feeling started gradually popping up in other shows, movies, fan posts that no one should take seriously. It's surprising how just having negative feelings for what is considered to be entertaining by everyone has made me second guess everything, panic, and spiral. Now I can barely enjoy anything because I'm terrified of it happening again and all I used to enjoy were movies and mindless entertainment and my list of this ""trope"" being used is always in the back of my mind, and is always instinctively making my insides hurt. Being unable to enjoy entertainment would be a minor problem if it didn't conflict with my passion, that I'm still working hard to get a job in and I have no other skills. What I think I've been feeling this whole time is heart-break.

I know this is just reddit but therapy isn't an option for me and I'm desperate for just a direction and everything I've tried has made it so much worse. I know this is long so if someone could at least read the first paragraph. (The rest is just describing the events from when it started to now to understand this in its entirety. I don't know what's relevant or not so its easier to just spill almost everything.)

I've posted about this before which was basically a vent but now I'm asking for help. This entire post is pretty overdramatic and pathetic. I understand how people might think this is disingenuous and hard to take seriously. I dislike fans who act as if a TV show is part of their identity, mostly doing it out of pride but that's not what I'm doing at all, I just happen to have crippling feelings about a reoccurring ""trope"". I've always been a very sensitive person and a massive overthinker. The source of this ""fear"", and for some reason it being fictional still makes no sense to me. I'm guessing understanding entertainment's irrelevancy to real life is something I never learned, and I would hold fiction that I loved to a standard higher than real life which massively backfired. I can't be specific about this because I'm reasonably ashamed of it. All I can say is that it's something weirdly specific that isn't to do with death, a breakup, and not always real life. It isn't really a fictional trope. It happens in real life too which scares me just as much but it's very common in all of entertainment because people enjoy it, which I can't stop and there's nothing morally or critically wrong it. It might be too much to ask for a real therapist or someone with experience to give me a direction. I know you shouldn't really trust strangers on Reddit but I trust Redditors more than my own stupid conscious that I can't understand. Is it because I'm lonely or undeveloped? What do I need? Grieving over a fictional event isn't something you can just google. I find it hard to believe myself. According to human psychology, this doesn't exist. I've never heard of someone grieving over fictional ""tropes"" that weren't related to a breakup or death and ruminated over it for 2 years. The idea of someone being afraid of something happening in real life equally to fiction doesn't make logical sense to me but it's exactly how I'm feeling. Does anyone know what this even is? If this was a form of autism, depression, or a trigger, I'd at least know where to go from, because I can actually google those words. The closest I've got to is ""grief"" and ""heart-break"" but even those words have different solutions depending on the context. I'm convinced that the reason nobody else experiences this is that my maturity is just ridiculously stunted. I've always known that I'm somewhat ditsy and stupid but I think this says something so ridiculously degenerate about me. It seems especially selfish that I'm posting this on a subreddit where people have had real-life trauma and I'm treating my literal made-up problems as the same level which I sincerely apologize for. Something I've learned from this is that death and loss are worth infinitely more attention than what I'm feeling.

I won't be specific about what the trope is or name any franchises. Even though it might help, it's really laughable. Admitting that I'm very sensitive to something that usually occurs in made-up fantasy lands is already hard to admit. I want to describe how my feelings have developed the best I can so that someone can hopefully understand a solution better than I can. In November 2018 I watched a few episodes of a TV show. I wasn't impressed but it held my interest enough to reach a scene that didn't sit right with me. About 5 months after I watched it, I randomly remembered that scene and other contextual scenes which made me feel uncomfortable. I realized that this feeling kept reoccurring, becoming more than just shower thoughts and became real-life achy feelings. This motivated me to finally watch the rest of season 1 to convince myself it doesn't bother me. It didn't until rewatching the triggering scene. I remember the feeling when it occurred to me, realizing that this made up instance is now a genuine problem I have and that I'll probably be ruminating over this fictional event for a while. I wanted to cry but just kept feeling uncomfortable and numb. I bought the original books, videogame adaptation, and watched the entire show. Most of my solutions for getting over this was entirely subconscious. I hadn't bought physical games or books in years and I hadn't (illegally) watched this much TV in years because my naïve subconscious thought ""facing my fears"" was the solution to getting over this. Being a fan of this show was a defence mechanism because I had physical proof on the shelf that I wasn't absolutely traumatized. I also watched anticipating that the show would redeem the event, which it almost did. There was a beautiful scene that unexpectedly teased something better which meant so much to me and kept me carefree and happy for about 2 months. When that happiness fizzled, I stopped watching it entirely. Now I have five books and one game in my house that I'd burn if I wasn't so sentimental. I went on a few vacations around this time and the majority of days out and long walks was just endlessly debating and ruminating, excusing why what happened and why I should or shouldn't feel grief or if this happens or not or if that was even canon. Every time I was silent just watching and arguing to myself in third person. Seeing just a screenshot of the event or someone describing it leaves me physically shivering, heating up, my heart rate goes right up, it almost deafens me, my motivation to do anything plummets while I ruminate over it for the next few days until I find something else to ruminate over. I'm almost glad that when I watched this show for the first time, it 0% concerned me because watching it for the first time as I am now would probably leave me feeling suicidal, just because of television. What happened in this show absolutely crushes my soul. It's now been over 500 days since I watched a full scene or even looked at related screenshots that I still remember perfectly, how can I still be devastated?

Whether I liked it or not, I spent my time away from that show worrying about this happening again, which indirectly caused it to, Through 2020 of all times, more shows, games, online comics, even memes now like this happened regularly. A videogame franchise that I recently got into used this trope and fans are on board with the idea of doing the same trope again in a different instance. This one hurts differently because I use to have fun with these games, and a possible sequel is something I'm absolutely dreading. One show that I loved had this trope which didn't initially bother me until 12 months after not watching it. That one trope overshadows everything I loved about that show and it hurts just as effectively as the show before. I desperately want to forget this one's existents. I even found a real-life example of this trope. As I said, there's nothing morally wrong with it, but that's not how my mind works anymore. In summary, my subconscious misunderstood what the real problem was. It wasn't the trope's fault but the way it was used in that show. Choosing to fear this trope caused a bigger and less reasonable internal reaction of pain each time, with each use of it becoming a less and less reasonable thing ruminate over. It used to take months to manifest in my head but now it happens in an instant, including three video games the previous month, one of which is animal crossing, which I used to love. This is the only franchise I'm labelling because I think it's necessary to know how pathetic I am. I've officially reached the peak.

What makes this so crippling and confusing is that I'm currently doing a media course and I want a job in art and visuals. I'm required to use some of this in my research. Creating art and types of imagery wasn't something I used as a distraction, It's something I've always appreciated and have been very passionate about. I've always wanted to peruse a career in something like concept art or movie visuals. I've reached the point where motivation has become less about what makes me happy and more about avoiding distress, so if trying to be inspired and make myself happy feels like walking on eggshells then what's the point. There's only so much emotional gratification I can get from Tetris. Like the time I pretended to enjoy that show, I've continuously created these fake feelings of relief and believed it's all over for little reason. But my subconscious isn't buying it anymore. The amount of times I've had fake relief to make myself feel better (like when I bought the books and game) just to be disappointed has left me unable to trust when I actually am happy. What I can or can't enjoy is entirely based on past context, I don't know what I'm really feeling, my opinions or what my genuine beliefs are and this very specific fear of something mostly occurring in fiction has established that I could be hurt by absolutely anything, without even considering intentions. I'm aching every fking day, triggered by basically nothing it just happens at this point. My negative feelings towards that show originally came from empathy and morality. I believed it was wrong but the show itself and its fans believed it was cool and admirable. Now my negative feelings have evolved into my own insecurity, my selfishness, feeling threatened, complete loss of faith in anything. Empathy and morality have little to do with the problem now. it's more unempathetic and immoral for me to encourage these feelings. I have no idea what my feelings are even fighting for.

When people describe a breakup or death, I can relate to that but solutions are something I can't relate to. To get over a breakup, you need to be realistic about it but fiction can be literally be anything and do whatever it wants. There are limitless possibilities to how the next thing could affect me. Pretty much anything that makes me feel emotion is motivated by this ""issue"" and avoiding it. I can imagine what it feels like to not be bothered by this, as somebody else or me before 2019 and it seems a lot less complicated, but obviously, that's not my default mode of thinking. If I died any time soon, my dying thoughts will be about one of these made up fantasies of other people. I can't believe that these thoughts have been my priority over any potential problems in the real world, like a virus. I'm fortunate to have never been affected by covid the slightest, but I just can't care. My view on everything has proven to be unreliable so It would mean a lot to get someone else's opinion on all of this, just to hear from a rational person with a brain who identifies real problems like a pandemic to no problems like stupid entertainment. Not that my situation is even worth anyone's time but I'd appreciate anyone reading this have anything to comment on it, and give some guidance on how to get back to how I used to be if possible. I'd love to be able to watch the entire show with no reminder of how I used to feel. Rather than being terrified of sequel announcements, I want to actually get exited again. I'd like to be able to finish my course, create art, and do my job without being traumatized. Please talk to me.",mentalhealth,2021-01-20 07:15:17

This is significantly higher than the 32% reported in March, the first time this question was included in KFF polling. All of us must have witnessed the irritated, frustrated, and negative change in behaviors of our loved ones and ourselves. I have seen people around me who had a few daily mental health habits that helped them sail through this pandemic. 

**Below are 5 practical habits to look after your mental health.**  
***1) Practice*** [positive self-talk](https://www.healthline.com/health/positive-self-talk)***:*** Simple rule, Don't say anything to yourself that you wouldn't say to anyone else. Your self-talk should contain less self-criticism and more self-acceptance. Accept the way you are, accepting yourself is the only way to overcome low self-esteem.

***2) Disconnect:*** This can be extremely difficult, but it’s imperative. Put your phone away. Rearrange your apps so the habit of opening Instagram/Facebook/Twitter isn’t so casual. Disconnect from the digital world. If we don’t escape our electronics, it makes it hard to turn off from work. If we can’t turn off, we can’t recharge.

***3) Ask for help:*** For some reason, many of us feel like a burden when we ask for help. The reality is, there are SO many people out there whose purpose and vocation is to help people like us. There doesn’t have to be something wrong for us to have a therapist. Therapy can be a critical component of a healthy life. ([10 Signs it’s time to see a therapist](https://calmerry.com/blog/therapy/do-i-need-therapy-10-signs-its-time-to-see-a-therapist/))

***4) Quit:***  We’ve all got areas of our lives that hold us back from flourishing. It could be a cigarette habit. It could be a relationship. Perhaps it’s our diet. Whatever it may be for you, let it go. Our mental health is more important than anything else &amp; if something is holding you back from happiness, say goodbye.

***5) Having a good night’s sleep:*** [Harvard health mentions](https://www.health.harvard.edu/newsletter_article/sleep-and-mental-health): *Americans are notoriously sleep-deprived, but those with psychiatric conditions are even more likely to be yawning or groggy during the day. Chronic sleep problems affect 50% to 80% of patients in a typical psychiatric practice, compared with 10% to 18% of adults in the general U.S. population. Sleep problems are particularly common in patients with anxiety, depression, bipolar disorder, and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).*

This means getting better sleep will directly and positively impact your mental health.",mentalhealth,2021-01-20 07:54:56

First of all for years, I've always thought that nobody would accept me for who I am, and if they know the real me, they would reject me. Second, I'd always have the feeling that I'm too lucky to be sad. I belong in a middle-class family (in a developing country) and I don't have difficulties with learning in school. I'm not in the lowest of the low, and because of that, I think that I'm too lucky to be sad. So whenever I feel sad, I'd always say that there's no reason to be sad. People always say that I'm a very lucky person and I am privileged, which puts pressure on me to be happy. Third, I'm feeling emotionally numb. Though yes I can feel happiness but not EXTREME happiness. When watching shows, I cannot connect with the emotions, and I feel like I'm becoming cold. I can't even cry anymore. Fourth, I didn't know that I actually had social anxiety, until I tried to read and take an online test (look, I'm a high school senior in a third world country so Psychologists/Psychiatrists are not an option), which states that I do have one. Fifth, I'm also feeling very lethargic. I'm always feeling tired but I cannot sleep early at all. I'd have to wait until 12-2 PM to sleep. Look, I cannot talk to my family about this. I also realized that I'm very secretive about myself, and in no way am I going to share this with any of my family members. I feel like I'm a very horrible and I can't take this anymore. I feel like I'm the least favorite family member of any of my family members. I tried to take an online test (because again, that's my only choice) and I found out that I have severe depression. Am I really? I'd never thought that this was what depression felt like. Am I really depressed? I mean I don't believe that I am. I can still look at things and still say ""I can keep on going"".

My \[25M\] fiancée \[24F\] and I have been together for going on 8 years, and I was made aware of her depression/anxiety when we first got together. I had no delusions going in, and this post isn't me 'realising' anything, just to be clear.  


Some info: She's on several types of medication and has been for years.

Over the years, her depression has followed the typical rollercoaster pattern. At her highest, she's hyper and giggly, at her absolute lowest, she's attempted her life. I've been there through everything, and while each plummet to rock bottom has of course weighed enormously on me, I've never put the focus on me, because I'm all too aware that she *cannot* help it. 

She's had to leave multiple jobs because she can't cope with the stress, and one manager even sacked her for opening up about being unfairly hazed in her first few weeks at a job she otherwise enjoyed. This, by nature of her anxiety, has further conditioned her to believe she can't talk to employers about her condition. Her current job has been a dream for her, and yes there are the normal work-related stresses, but she's handled everything well.

It's become very clear, however, that her medication is not working, or if it *is,* it's scratching the surface of an even larger beast than the doctor's she seen ever imagined. Life itself is becoming an overwhelming task for her now, though she does find genuine happiness and calm in streaming on Twitch, it goes right back to the darkness as soon as the camera shuts down.  


She has a counselor; who in my opinion isn't offering any insight or getting her to challenge herself or views. She comes out of the session feeling completely unaffected by it, but the waiting list is so long that finding a new one almost seems counter-intuitive given she at least has another person to talk to. 

The doctors she's seen don't seem to understand that no matter what dosage of anti-depressants she's given, it's not working. She's getting worse and deathly afraid she's going to lose another job. I'm frantic because I know where this would put her, and what self-destructive coping mechanisms she'll jump to.  


Now, I'm not after sympathy. Countless others across the globe are facing this too, but I just need to vent. My family have already been through this at my side, and are too, *for want of a better word, '*fragile' to cope with her mental illness. I can't talk to them lest I wish to cause an argument. I don't see a light right now, and if anything comes from this post, it's the hope that someone else is in my position too.  


I'm so sorry to all of you who either live with an illness or are struggling to cope in proximity to it.

I hate to admit where I am currently at, but things just ain't going right, and I feel like my mental health is suffering, badly, and I can't keep it to myself anymore, how bad things are.

I grew up with a lot of friends, being popular in school and fast forward to the years before high school, in my country around age 14-15, me and a lot of my friends, started to experiment with smoking weed, going to parties etc. Which was definitely the time of our lives at that time haha. We were all really close and pretty much always had a good time. (I smoked a lot of weed in this period from maybe 14-16 years old).

Then life went on ....

I met my ex gf in December 2018, where I was seriously manipulated and controlled for almost 2 years. I broke up with her in October 2020, due to me not even recognizing myself anymore, and because I've felt bad for a very long time, in that relationship. 

New Years Eve 2019/2020, I got drugged by some of my best friends (no one has admitted anything, even though I tested positive for MDMA and I caught one of them in lying), which caused me to then make a decision and decide to cut that friend group off, completely, because they simply didn't serve me. This of course happened before I broke up with my ex girlfriend, so I knew, when I was going to break up with my girlfriend, I would really be a lot on my own. I still have very few friends, but not some that I see that often.

Now I just find myself in despair, excruciating social anxiety, that I have never experienced before. I have dealt with social anxiety before, but not to this degree, it's a whole new level and I just don't recognize myself anymore and I don't feel like I am on the same wavelength as society anymore, at all! 

I am constantly afraid that I am in some sort of dream, and that something horrible will happen. I am so afraid of losing my mind, it's crazy. I have a really hard time deciding to take on a job, but I need money and fuck nothing just makes sense anymore.

I used to be the type of guy who loved to be creative, start businesses, go for runs, go to parties, have fun with girls etc. Now when I go on dates, I even attract the most beautiful ladies, but I just have no interest in them, my libido is absolutely zero!!!  Which is also an indicator, that something is not as it should be in my body.

I constantly worry about what everyone thinks about me, I feel like I am some sort of monster and everybody is afraid of me, or that everybody thinks that I am in some completely other space.. It such a terror feeling..... I can't even describe it.

Sometimes I get confidence for some short time, and everything goes great, and then I am back in this confusing hell. I've been thinking that I might have PTSD or CPTSD or maybe I am just going crazy?

I had an experience with psychedelic shrooms, some months before I broke up with my ex girlfriend, I've tried before, and always been very cautious about doing it right and making it safe for myself and doing it in a responsible way. But this trip was just very very weird, I didn't even hallucinate, but it was like I was shifting between realities, and I couldn't grasp what reality was real anymore. It was really horrifying, but I rode it out and of course got back to reality again, but I can't help but think, that maybe that experience did something to me?

Anyways, I haven't felt like myself since maybe July/August 2019. 

I have been to trauma therapists, coaches etc. I just feel like no one really understands, maybe I haven't been transparent enough about what I experience. 

I also have some sort of problem in my stomach, I got tested positive for some sort of infection, so I am going to the a abdominal lab thing in the beginning of February, maybe that is causing me some problems as well?

Also, I just worry constantly, I get nowhere with my life, I am stuck and I feel like nothing makes sense, I don't know what I am anymore. I feel utterly detached!

Sometimes when talking to people, I just can't get words out, I am forcing myself to talk, but I have just nothing to say, I am afraid of saying something wrong I think, I am afraid of .. I don't really know?! I am writing all this today, because I went to see my sister today and have a coffee with her and a walk outside, and the vibes between us was just weird. She said that I acted really strange and she almost got scared, because she felt I was just staring at her. Which was never my intention, maybe I just were trying to figure out if she thought something about me, or I tried to read her to see if I was acting strange. It was so uncomfortable.

I am afraid, I don't know what's happening, what to do? I have no drive to do anything.

&amp;#x200B;

Some extra info if that helps:

I am 22 Male btw, and I eat pretty healthy, have always been positive but a deep thinker, I'm often the guy who helps people with their issues, I am a people pleaser, I've become better at knowing my own worth, Maybe this is just me standing up for myself for the first time in life really, and feeling the consequences and the mental labour of that?

TL;DR. 

Decided to cut off my social circle

Broke up with narcissistic ex girlfriend

Feeling detached, like I am in a completely other space

Have had a weird experience with psychedelic mushrooms

I am freeze responding in social situations 

I am not at all able to flow in social situations, I just stay quiet, where I used to be able to flow with conversations and chit chat.

More shit has happened to me since I spoke to people outside of the house and it’s obviously been detrimental to the friendship but the longer it goes on the more stuff happens, the less they know, the more I have to tell them and the less energy I have to do so. Now it’s at the point where I don’t know if I’ve burned bridges by not explaining how I feel and why we don’t talk anymore... 

Essentially to list: 
Medication changes result in severe side effects 
sleep all over the place
anxiety (sickness)
fear of leaving the house
left my job due to MH
different diagnosis &amp; symptoms
Chronic pain 
Trying to find a therapist
So many appointments health &amp; job wise

All these things combined mean I am very unwell a lot of the time and find speaking to external people effort I can’t always handle, I find it hard to keep my family in the loop with all this too. Yet I still miss our friendships obvs, I’m wondering if anyone has experience reconciling with people due to their symptoms?

Now why I felt the anger today? I figured I might play this game for a bit. It's 3v3 medieval knight simulator. You wave with sword and see who fares better. It's a skill-based game.

I think my rage due to loss is from feeling inferior to other players who've beaten me. And somehow I think I have a fear of the consequence of losing. Nothing really happens when you lose but I feel as if I've lost my value? Or that I don't matter anymore and if I lose again and again I'm at the very bottom of the social pit.

So recently my anxiety had a field day on bringing up mistakes I made in the past when I didn't no they were wrong and making them out that I was a bad person and no-one will live me because I did these things and I will live a lonely depressed life forever. This made me depressed until I finally realised that worrying wont change what I did and I am not that person now and the fact that it pained me so much to have ever done them shows I've changed and they were just dumb mistakes I made, no matter how bad they may sound if I just told some-one I did them I'm a good person now and they should be left in the past. However I can't do that as every time I see a happy family it starts again saying ill never have that. I try tell myself its just my brain playing tricks on me and I try to ignore it but when I do it makes me think that I'm saying that my actions were good by ignoring it and that I should be ashamed forever for what I did and I'm living a lie by ignoring it and I am a horrible person, even though I tell myself that this was all a dumb mistake I made when I was 12 and I shouldn't worry about it as I'm a good person now. However I can't get one thought out of my head that one day I am going to have a wife and I'll tell her what I did and she will leave me and my life will fall apart. I know it was a dumb mistake but I can't let it go and I always compare myself to people saying they are better than me because they haven't done what I did, I cant even watch my favourite TV shows now because I constantly tell myself I will never be what they and everyone else is because I am a bad person!

But somehow I always wanted an elder sister. To care of me, show compassion. I tried to strike up a close bond with my cousin sister. But she never cared until she needed my help. I realized, she wasn't the sister I wanted. 

In my culture, girls leave their house after marriage. After they get married they don't call their little brothers daily, don't care for them like before, they lose compassion for their little brothers. 


Whenever I see girls getting married or wedding photos I feel like the little brother(if she has one) is losing the compassion of the sister. I've stopped going to weddings, I've stopped seeing wedding photos. But somehow when I see, my day is ruined for sure. 

Also, when see a maternal uncle holding the baby, I feel like now the sister has become a mother, she'll give him even less time.

I don’t know if this post belongs here but I wouldn’t be posting unless I was desperate. 

A few months ago, my mother attempted suicide, I found her and she was taken to hospital and ended up being okay. I love my mother infinitely and this is without a doubt the hardest thing I’ve ever had to deal with, in fact I felt like a big part of myself died that day. My mum has since maintained the stance that this was my fault. I cannot express to you the pain of having my mum, the woman who I always saw as my best friend, looking me in the eyes and saying this countless times, very nonchalantly, even though I have always tried my best to support her. I have always suffered from anxiety but it has been exponentially worse since this event, I have severe panic attacks often and live everyday in fear that she will hurt herself, and am almost afraid of speaking to her because I fear that if I disagree with her over the slightest thing she will try and hurt herself again. 

Many people close to me who know us both have said that she is being manipulative, holding her life over my head in a way. I do feel responsible for keeping her alive, but the mental toll is almost unbearable. Am I wrong for feeling this way? I feel horrible because part of me truly believes she is being manipulative and that suicide / suicide attempts should not be blamed on anyone, but the other part of me feels almost evil for thinking that.

With the exposure of the abundant underlying societal problems that have long been eschewed by the ruling class and accepted by the working class as “life’s not fair” which has been generationally indoctrinated in their children, perhaps we will see this phenomenon addressed more appropriately.",mentalhealth,2021-01-20 09:52:01

So im a senior highschooler and im in a very big crisis both in career and mental state vise. These two connected actually.

To be precise when this schoolyear started i just turned on panic mode. I dont know what i want to do with my life and im regretting choiches, though i dont know what would have been better. Im really scared from graduation as well because it dont look like a piece of cake , and a we spent a very big amount of time in online school wich lacking from lot of important stuff. 

Im overthinking, stuck in a facilitating anxiety that paralizes me to the core. Im full of fear and i feel like there could be no happy future for me. Im not just second guessing myself , i go through a simple question like 20+ times and im still not sure. I lack of self worth as well. And in the end these choices are need to made by me.

Its not really helping that i have a kind of manipulating father who dont believe that there is actually a stuff called "" mental illness"". At least he thinks only people with shaking seizures and people whit serious mental incapabilities have mental illnesses. He thinks im hysterical and over reacting. He is matearialistic. Im not saying he is a bad peson, he really loves me (in hi own way) but Im not like that. He wants me to act l/and make choiches like he does.  It is usually "" be determined about something or just do as I say"".He wants to control everithyng in spite of saying the opposite. He has a very big effect of my life and i uncoucosly want to satisfy his expectacions but i dont want to. But every time i want to share an idea with him wich dont meets his expectacions he starts to ramble about the disadvantages , the bad effectors and its really not helping since im not a determined person. We cant even sit down to talk about important maters of my future because he takes over the conversations and i just get loaded of anxiety and shame at the end. 

My time is soon ending and this is my time to make choiches but im still paralized. Im full of fear that every choiche i make i cant turn back from and my life will break dow more into sadness. I cant make decidions because im scared and I feel my head is not clear but im afraid of missing more and more opportunities. I know its better to do something than not fo anything but IM SO SCARED.( sometimes thinking i just want to be gone) . Im just working on half power and my results are getting worst and weaker as I am even after im going to a pschigologyst. Like one step forward but two steps backwards.

Often I have been some this depressive episodes (its almost cyclical) where I feel, from 1 to several days, hopelessness, worthlessness, oversleep, dont have motivation to do anything, even the simple tasks. But lately, I've become aware of somethings that happens in and out of this episodes. I tend to see things where they aren't, but they aren't full on hallucinations (e.g. i was walking behind my gf lookin at the floor, and when i look up i see she climbed the stairs - only saw just a little of her legs and back climbing - of our house, when I asked where she was going she told me but she had entered in the bathroom, not the stairs, and to which she said ""i'm in the bathroom, why you asking why i am climbing?""), other times it feels like I see partial people as well from the corner of my eyes (a pair of legs, a arm swinging, etc, where there was no objetcts that could be moving to cause the illusion). Another curious stuff, yesterday i was talking with my girlfriend, wishing her a good night and said ""i love you, sleep tight and have great dreams"" (and i vividly remember of opening my mouth), she sweared on her hands and knees that i stopped talking at ""i love you"". This last thing happens a lot, where in my mind I say and do stuff that I didnt actually do. I've grown worried about this, adding the cycilcal depressive episodes, but since we are in confinement I'm unable to talk to psychologist. And I know I shouldn't be asking here on the internet, but I'm just curious to see if any of you can connect any of this strange behaviours to a known mental issue, or by chance been going through the same thing.

Any job you take will last at least 6 months, and this is the minimum. People generally advise that you shouldn't change job frequently to give the impression that you are unreliable and can't hold a job. This means any decision you make to accept a job, or do a career change would affect you life for a year. A person doesn't have this many years to get this right?

The process of finding employment is also creates a lot of mental stress and ambivalence. For example, just how much do you want the job or like your existing job? How much effort should you put into it? One starts to think things such as ""I don't care if the interview went badly, I didn't like the job anyway"". These sorts of thoughts drives indicision and stress.

Currently going through a rough breakup around some messy circumstances that perfectly ping my insecurities (self worth, being replaced, not being good enough, etc.). I've always struggled mentally and I figure now is as good a time as ever to try getting help. I just don't know where to start. I haven't seen a therapist in probably 4 years, and even then I don't think it was really help I was looking to get.

About me if it helps, I'm 21, male, he/him, I've never had a good relationship with my parents (growing up I was always told that I'm worthless and I'm never going to get anywhere in life). When I'm not seeing anyone, I feel like life doesn't really have purpose and I just feel like I'm on auto pilot just going with no goal. Like life is just kinda sedentary if that makes any sense? I'm uncomfortable talking about my feelings, around people (even my friends with a few exceptions) I cover it all up, sometimes I fake a God complex just because it's easier than going into the real story. I know I struggle with body dismorphia, anxiety, codependency (and thus jealousy), and depression. I never feel well rested and half the time call in late to work because I can't be motivated to get up. Sometimes sleeping is weird because it just feels like I'm trapped, just staring at the ceiling but can't move or do anything. I've never tried medication to treat anything, I can't smoke weed because of where I work (and whenever I try I get really paranoid anyways). I've never really thought that I had an eating disorder but I definitely either under or over eat when I'm in a bad mental place. Minor history with self harm and suicidal thoughts, but I haven't really thought about suicide for years now. 

I think if I continue down my same path, I'm never gonna find whatever it is I'm searching for. I really don't want to be this way, and I wish I could have a normal relationship with my family and a normal relationship with my partners.

So, I mostly realize this when playing games but it's a thing that hurts my everyday life at times and makes me depressed/very frustrated at times: basically the more I strive to do something the less I can do it, for example in games if I focus too hard on doing a mechanic or a pattern I can't do it but if the same thing happens when I'm talking or in a less ""serious"" ambient I can do it perfectly. So basically it's not a can I do it problem, 'cause I can, it's not even a performance anxiety 'cause I had/still have it and can recognise when it's that acting.

At first I thought I was just being a whiney little shit. Which hey, that might actually be the case. I started researching things like depression, anxiety, and schizophrenia. I ignored all of it, because I couldn't really apply everything to me. I'll list some symptoms and see what y'all think.

- Lack of motivation
- Delusions
- Lack of empathy
- Suicidal thoughts
- Unwillingness to speak
- Paranoia

Those are the major ones. Of course now I got the thoughts creeping in that ""hey, every normal person experiences these things, you're not special."" But fuck it, might as well get other people's opinion on it",mentalhealth,2021-01-20 12:02:27

I moved 3/4 hours away from home 2 years ago and I have never quite settled down and due to COVID - 19 this will be frankly impossible to do for the up coming future. I moved with my partner but because we are together all the time with no outside hobbies or socialization , I feel further apart from him than ever. 

My friends from home and college have all but disappeared emotionally , they have moved on with their lives (had kids last and this year and got engaged and new jobs). I feel stuck and alone wanting nothing more than something like that to happen me. I have been supportive of my friends through every celebration they had and every cry that they had - but when it comes to me I’m left on my own it feels like I’m my only audience whether I’m celebrating a success or a downfall. I have tried talking to my partner about it all but it’s hard to place this burden on him every time I feel down during the entire quarantine. 

Lately I’ve been more suicidal, I want to do it - I want to end my pain. I want someone to care and listen ,because I don’t want to die but I want to see some relief, but no one does. I’ve reached out to my parents , I’ve reached to who I thought are my close friends , I have laid it all out for my partner and I’ve detailed my feelings to medical and professional help and they all clarify the same thing - get over it. I was starving myself or getting sick if purged (still do) and once I visited a medical professional - they told me I was too fat to have those problems. For my mental health I had described in detail how someone bullied me .... the psychiatrist’s reply? You should have given him a chance I think he had a crush on you. I had a middle class lifestyle growing up and because I never was left without , I shouldn’t be upset over anything (what I’ve been told anyways...).

All I wanted for 2021 (which I had planned mentally) was to start a family ... after traveling the world in 2020 ( I even had all the flights booked). I’ve been with my partner nearly 10 years. But as my mental health deteriorated the last year, so did my support and ties. My family moved on without me as I lived so far away. My friends told me I was stupid for wanting kids but congratulated and expressed nothing but sheer excitement to our other mutual friends that did have babies. One friend even went as far as to tell me I would make a terrible mother and ruin my partners life with my mental health after I voiced my mental health concerns and accidental envy at other new mothers. 

I know this has been a shitty for everyone and I am lucky to be an essential worker and have a job. I am sitting in work typing this wondering whether to go home and just do it at this stage. No one would miss me or care.",mentalhealth,2021-01-20 12:31:23

Like the title says, I’m really just in pain and hurt all the time. I’ve never posted something like this before, let alone vent and type out coming up to two decades worth of hurt. I don’t know where to start other than when I was little.

I have always had very early memories and recollections as a young kid, maybe 4 at the earliest, where I can recall feeling what I’ve always felt to now- my adult life. My childhood was rather average. Good family, bigger than most, devout believers of their faith, hardworking, family was important. I have 4 siblings. When me and my twin sister were born, there was 12-16 years of age difference between us and our older 2 sisters and brother.
They all moved out when I was younger, long before I was able to make meaningful relationships with them being a child and them being young adults and starting life. 

  Going back to when I was 4, I’ve always felt a very pervasive sense of loneliness and experienced literal loneliness, senses impending doom, sadness and a very harsh feeling of disconnection from people and the world that still persist today with a multitude of other things. I was bullied quite often growing up in school. Constant teasing, ostracizing, intimidation, shaming and always labelled and kept from expressing anything. Never trusted, or picked with delight for something, more so the last option in a bucket. The times I spoke up for help or because it was getting to be too much it was never met with resolve. The same things kept happening, the same people got away with their antics and the same punishment was endured relatively everyday by myself. I can still remember hiding in stalls in locker rooms in gym class to just hope to be left alone. The same guys then we’re the same ones who cornered me in a basement closest at a kids birthday party (former childhood friends) when we we’re 7 or 8 and yelled and shoved me around yelling sexual explicits and making fun of me and my body and refusing to let me leave. Even the friends parents wouldn’t believe me when I was eventually able to tell them and wouldn’t let me phone home to leave. Being the kid from the religious family also didn’t bring any less heat or source for their new ways to hurt me. 

  Making friends was always so hard and still is hard. Even when I played sports and trained heavily, I was still met with the same awful days as I experienced in grade school into high school. There is when things really made my mental health dive deep into hell. High school was and still is one of the most unbelievably lonely and and hard times I’ve gone through. No amount of exercise, training, art ( used to draw a lot), or much reduced, helped, or alleviated anything. Couldn’t against the amount of isolation and disregard my existence had there.
I have a few friends but my constant experience and feeling is I’m more of just a background friend. I feel more of an afterthought. With everyone. All my siblings are older and married, some with kids, even my twin sister is married. All of them have really not taken much interest in my life. Not that my life really has much going on to talk about.

  Sitting on my bed this morning getting out to go do work I just sat there like the many times I have before and just not know what to do with the day. So it can just be done. So I can just be alone and away. I hurt and hurt and hurt all the time. There is almost never a moment when I can just not be in pain or losing myself inside my head. I fantasize in so much anger and violence, I want connections so I can feel normal, but the realities case just says no. The constant anxiety and depression, impending doom, the anger, the boredom, the loneliness, the emptiness, no matter what I’ve tried over the years, if I try to put good into it, with something to try and help me it just brings nothing to me all while feeling so much care and concern for people and a world that i just simply don’t believe would do the same for me. I saw someone post here about the first 30 seconds of waking up to be the only time of a sense of calm before the anxiety sets back in. I don’t even get that anymore. 

All I feel is cold .. numb.. and apathetic. I am simply just not functioning anymore. I don’t know how to believe others feel what I’m feeling. I really don’t have anyone to talk to. My constant survival mode is working slower and slower and the point of it all has left me long, long ago. I simply just hurt all the time.",mentalhealth,2021-01-20 13:06:10

My relationship with my dad is emotionally draining.  I don’t know how, but I try my best to look out for him and tell him how much I care for him.  I understand he’s had a terrible childhood and that he tries to be a good person, however the shit he does sometimes really gets to me and my sister.  For example, my childhood has made become a very physiological scarred individual.  I have so many memories of my dad degrading my self-worth and yelling because I can’t answer his questions - these types of questions would best be described as rhetorical - where he had already decided to the answer. A few hours ago, my sister was the victim of my dad’s belligerence.  He was drunk and came into my sister’s room to talk to her. The topic pertained to her not sending out a card saying thanks to her grandma for the gifts she received. This was an interrogation, he said as much. I was there trying to support my sister while also trying to limit the hostility from my dad.  It didn’t work. He kept demanding for an explanation while also denying ever attempt my sister made to explain herself saying things like “don’t you dare say distract. Distract means it’s somebody else’s fault”. He pushed her to tears and even then he barely stopped. He later came into my room to ask if he did anything wrong.  Me being insane and believing I could actually explain, I talked about how his questioning was an interrogation with a sense of hostility rather than an earnest attempt to understand.  He told me I was bullshit and that I would never make a good lawyer with flimsy reasoning.  Tonight, he struck a nerve again somehow. It made me think badly and I considered both self-reflection and the opposite.  I’ve known and felt this in my entire being for the good portion of my life, however, it hasn’t been until tonight that I’ve had the ability to put this into words.  This is it for now.

For the last 4 years I’ve been plagued with a constant fear I’m going to die. A scenario plays out in my head and it becomes so real that I’m convinced in that moment it’s my truth. Last night for example I was convinced I was going to die from carbon monoxide poisoning (though we have carbon monoxide detectors). I played through my last day/last interactions and how I didn’t pay enough attention to my boyfriend and I didn’t hug him enough because I was preoccupied with school and work. I thought about how my last interaction with my Mabear was her saying she didn’t want to talk to me anymore. I thought about how I didn’t say enough thank yous, I love yous, and I guess accomplish what I want to accomplish. 
There are nights I can’t sleep because the thought of sleeping is scary to me. 
Yesterday was also a REALLY good day, my grandma called and said she’d help me pay for my school, I finished my financial aid application, was able to get things done I needed. It’s always unexpected, this happens maybe 2-9 times a month. Is this maybe a combination of severe anxiety and intrusive thoughts? I currently am uninsured and can’t afford an actual diagnosis so I’m reaching out in hopes someone knows something or can maybe provide insight on their own experience.

I have never been attracted both physically and emotionally to another person before. 

As a disclosure, I have had social anxiety as well as regular anxiety for about 6 years now but I have noticed that it has been at its worst the last year or so (possibly because of COVID but not too sure).

About a month ago we tried to have sex for the first time but as I went to put on a condom I lost the erection. She has been very supportive and we tried again today, thinking today was the day because I feel much more comfortable with her than I did a month ago. 

As we were getting to it I could not get an erection because I was so nervous and overthinking that I wasn’t going to be able to perform again. After that I wound up apologizing and almost cried because I felt so defeated and disappointed in myself. 

I am very healthy, I workout 6 times a week and eat very healthy so I know it has nothing to do with my body, especially since I am still able to masturbate and achieve an erection. 

My question is: what should I do? I have no idea, my friend (who has the same mental issues as me) had the same issue with his girlfriend and he said it took a few tries until it finally happened. I have considered going on medication for my anxiety but I fear pills like that and the side effects that come with them.

Over the past few months, I've found myself increasingly becoming more and more enchanted with the idea of escaping reality. Love is the only thing that I deeply value and in my opinion the only thing that would make life worthwhile. However, because of a fundamental belief that love will never work out the way I want it to in reality,  Therefore I've figured that the only escape that I have is by escaping reality, in whatever way possible. For example, despite being depressed on a daily basis I would like to live forever because I think that if I can live for long enough then eventually technology will allow for me to simulate love through some combination of robots, simulations, and memory-altering. I could get more into technical details but its basically just me proving that it's somehow possible to feel loved. 

Because of this, insanity appeals to me a lot. I'm extremely tired of trying and waiting in this world to find meaning so I wouldn't mind being insane. To be completely honest it's actually a hope of mine to be unable to distinguish fantasy and reality so I can live in a fantasy world just as easily. 

 I lost my moral compass a while ago and I don't really get disturbed by anything anymore unless I force myself to. I have friends I guess but theyre all just people I get along with well in school. None of them know how I think. I pretend to have hobbies but I really don't find pleasure in doing anything. Recently, I've been falling behind on schoolwork. 

What do I do to just feel better? It's been years since I felt normal. In this time, I've tried 4 different therapists and countless different types and amounts of medication and they all help a bit but I always just get worse again.

I've suffered from really bad anxiety since I was a little girl. Coming from a Mexican household, it was kind of over-looked?

They got me a therapist in elementary school, but it was a group and at school one (so didn't really help).

It's recently become much more than I can handle because of college. Financial stress, class stress, homework stress, job stress, and so much more is making it unbearable. I've kept my anxiety attacks (and depression) to myself and I've never told my parents; in fear of being a burden or causing them to spend money on me that I feel wouldn't be necessary/help me in any way. 

How do I ask my parents for anxiety medication... I've never reached out to them about my mental health and I'm scared and clueless. But I want to get better so badly. I want to be able to hang out with friends, live my life, and be able to do things with out having multiple anxiety attacks before. I chose a college away from home because I want to be independent and rely less on those around me. But my anxiety is weighing me down so much. It's hard to do anything these days.

Thoughts of my past fill me with hate, how to let go.","Firstly I like to say that I am not a native English speaker so I am sorry if I make some spelling errors.

Second, this is a throwaway because of some very dark stuff. But my main question is how do you let go from the past.

A little about me, I was very passive in my past, I would let people choke or beat me and I would never fight back because I was afraid of being alone. My father was, is, very narcissist, so I could never be sad around him. My mother was better for comfort but would always tell everything to my father that would later yell at me. I am in my thirties now and the only reason why my father don't raise his voice is because now I am stronger and he can't drag me around with me arm while yelling.

&amp;#x200B;

* in public school at age age 7-16, my classmates would bully me a lot, one guy would like to choke me in the break time. And I would receive daily beating by a one year older student that picked me for the beatings because I was the weakest in the classroom. In the end I would spend more time in the neighbour class in the break times just to be away.

&amp;#x200B;

* in high school/college at age 16 to 19 I was in a classroom where one guy would choke me every break time for my face to change colour, while my other classmates would laugh.

&amp;#x200B;

* at university at age 19 to 21, I was bullied very little. But I was developing depression and I think my classmates noted so they stopped, it was not so mean bullying, still unpleasant but not hateful bullying. I dated a muslim girl, but her father tried to stab me with one of my kitchen knives because I was a non believer and did not want to believe in a god. I was starting to gain muscles so I just punch him to the ground so he flied, and I broke up with the girl. In the university a teacher was bullying me. He even tried to choke me from behind but I beat him. He was angry because I did not want to greet him while passing him. He then later tried to throw me out of university but I could prove that he was bullying with audio/video recordings and said I would go to the media, then the university did not throw me out. But I later quit myself because of depression and I had trouble sleeping. I would go 3 days without sleep and then sleep 1 day.

&amp;#x200B;

* at age 25 another father tried to kill me for not wanting to marry his daughter. He was, in my believe, mentally sick. When I think back as a child at his farm, he would enjoy to  torturing animals, blowing smoke into his dogs faces and picking the wings of flies to watch them try to flee before squishing them with his thumb. He wanted me to marry his daughter, and my childhood friend, because he promised his dying wife that I would. She died of cancer at the same year. But I gave him a good beating when he tried to stab me with a steak knife for saying no to marrying his daughter. Like the first father I would not report it to the police because it would just mean more trouble. But he would continue to threaten me by text messages, so I would report him to the police. The problem now was, his dead wife worked at a prison as a nurse, so when I mentioned that he was trying to kill me, with the text messages as prof, the officer just said ""but his wife is just dead"". The police said they would talk to him but nothing happened, he would still threaten to kill me, but now he made some of his police friends threaten me at my home. Pointing their guns at me and threaten me. I made it stop by calling his workplace and stated that if he would not make it stop I would release all the text messages and my audio recordings of the officers threaten me to the news. Then it stopped.

&amp;#x200B;

* around at 26 I would go to a school reunion meeting at the public school class. The guy that enjoyed choking me as a child did it again. I turned around and said don't you do that again, but he choked me again so I beat him in front of everyone. Later I received a messages on Facebook saying that my bully would report me to the police, but I said that he was choking me twice and I even asked him to stop so I was acting in self defence, while trying ""what will you tell the police, he beat me after I choked him twice and I even asked me to stop"". Then my bully said he would just tell the police a lie that I started so I took a screenshot of the monitor screen and said please do call the police, but nothing happened. The screenshot was so I could prove that my bully would make a police report on a false claim. But it was a group chat so my entire class was in on lying to the police.

&amp;#x200B;

* at the same year I also went class reunion for my highschool/college, and my bully there did the same thing and started to choke me while my classmate was laughing and but I also beat him. My teacher tried to guilt me by saying ""I had so high hope for you"" but I said ""you never gave me a compliment in class, you always yelled at me in class and even yelled at me when other people was making the mistake, you never believed in me and never said one nice thing to me, and why did not never protect me while I was being choked"" and I left.

&amp;#x200B;

There are more incidence where I have been bullied/beaten but there is not so impactful. But I notice a pattern. I was bullied a lot because I was the perfect target, the worse bullies, the chokers, was always small guys. I am around 190cm and the male bullies that choked was always around 170cm. So I am sure since I was a perfect target that never hit back that I was a easy source of feeling powerful for the small guys. 

I realise that I was passive because I was afraid of being alone. I have nobody in my family to talk to, since my father was always aggressive and had a childlike mentality that when I, a child, could prove him wrong in something, or I did not enjoy his teaching/opinion, then he would yell and be angry. So I accepted the beating at school because my young mind needed someone to talk now.

And the teacher, well they was just bad teachers, that probably did nothing because it would mean more work for them.

Now I am, well I am not aggressive, but if someone is aggressive towards me and I answer with aggression. I know in a perfect world one should not answer a punch with a punch of course, but in a perfect would nobody should experience my childhood. But I view it as a positive thing that now I dare to stand up for myself, I am not allowing myself to be beating or threaten. I have self respect. I will quickly add that I don't start with aggression myself, but I can answer with it when like someone try to punch me, or if someone yell at me then I yell back, and so on.

&amp;#x200B;

So I am over the past in the sense that I know why the people did it. My father yelled at me because he was a narcissist, the father tried to kill me because they are bigger narcissists, the children bullied and beat me because I was the perfect victim, and the teacher never helped because that would just be more work/trouble for them.

I one thing I could add is that one time when to a psychologist because I was depressed after university. But that was not a pleasant experience either. He would call me stupid multiple times, saying ""people like me should not have children, pets or plants"" and he broke multiple laws. But when I tried to report him nothing happened, he had a high rank in the healthcare system and had published three brooks so someone probably protected him and his name. There is a saying here called ""the white coats club"" it is basically implying that doctors help doctors in situations of law and complain reports. So I don't trust that system. and now I dont have the money for that kind of service so it is not a option.

So I would prefer some ""self help"" kind of thing. I am fond of philosophy that I giving me tool for great inside and a way to analyse my past, but I am not in a perfect state of mind. I am still experience hate, I realise that I might never be able to let it go but maybe there is tools to better handle it. other tools that screaming in my pillow of course :)

By the way I will read the answer, I don't know when, it take a lot of mental energy to talk about these past experience and it is not pleasant. And I need to recharge my mind before I confront this again. I am sorry if I don't answer so fast but I will read it.

&amp;#x200B;

Hey, first time poster here, and it’s a little bit scary. I guess I am having what can best be described as an existential crisis, and wanted to hear what some people have to say about Meds? 

Tldr; do you take meds, was it the best/worst decision/made no difference?

I am having a terrible time at my job, I am a foreigner where I live and am quite alienated by language at work (I have tried with the locals, trust me). I work in research and the project is just not working as it should, so there is an element of failure there. I guess when everything was fine (with the world) I didn’t realise how isolated I was, but now that all other social aspects of life have diminished, I think everything negative is just amplified.

I have always been focused on career and work, never really had a relationship, but I used to make friends really easily. As the years have gone by, my social anxiety has just gotten worse and worse, and I just find people harder and harder to be around. Sometimes I get the feeling that now I am just ruined beyond repair. It is also really affecting my work, I can’t concentrate, or even keep a train of thought for more than 5 minutes. I sit in meetings and I have no Idea what people are talking about, and I just feel like I’m stupid. I don’t want to be depressed, but I also don’t feel like I have the strength to make things better for myself. To be quite honest, the best way I can describe how I feel, is I want to lay on a cloud, and float up into the sky forever. I guess the scariest truth is, I just can’t imagine my future anymore.

Every day I leave work, and I try my hardest to hold in my tears until I get home.

I have tried to get help here, Therapy is complicated, I have to undertake it in my second, and not so fluent, language, and also I have been on a waiting list for months to get into a practice, but its forever extended. And I just want to add, I use exercise like an endorphin junkie, min 4 times a week, sometimes it makes me feel good and sometimes I cry while I’m jogging down the street. It’s not great.

Anyway, the doctor offered me medication, I don’t know if it is the stigma, or the fact that this is really then accepting that I am now officially depressed, but I said no. But as the waiting list continually grows, and things are only getting worse in my head, I am thinking about it.",mentalhealth,2021-01-20 15:01:18

Or attend. I already dropped out of my previous high school, which had higher qualifications (I had very good grades and exam scores in basic school). Although I took my papers out before they officially, the next day, proclaimed it. 
I have had a very low attendance rate, especially this year. It's less than 25%. In one subject I haven't even seen the teacher. I have a lot of missed assignments. Which makes me more anxious and so I'm more likely to not go and turn anything in.
I know that it's one of the root problems but I do not know how to deal with it, the only motivation I get is if I'm past the deadline and just have to do it. But then it's often late or too burdensome. 
My teacher wrote to me, that in their opinion I will not be able to graduate in spring and that they don't know or can't help.
I don't even like staying at home, doing nothing. I don't get along with my parents and the household is quite toxic. When I drop out, I will most likely be kicked out.
My current plan with the latter scenario is to join the military service earlier. What I will do after that, without middle education, remains quite empty.
I feel ashamed in front of my teachers, classmates and friends who have tried to help. I don't want to face them when I do drop out. I didn't face them in my previous school either.

If anyone has experienced similarly, what have you done and how have you dealt with the social pressure?",mentalhealth,2021-01-20 15:04:58

My ex boyfriend (24m) and I lived together, he exhibited very emotionally abusive behaviour. Screaming in my face daily, blaming me for things that went wrong in his life, calling me names, saying I was an embarrassment, throwing things at me etc. Anyway, this relationship ended with him beginning a relationship with somebody else weeks before ours had ended. The person he began the relationship with was a work colleague of his, who we BOTH considered a friend. Obviously, I was wrong. 
Anyway, I’m over the initial heartbreak as it has been a little over three months now. However, since then I’ve been struggling with a strange affliction. Any woman I see on TV or in real life resembles the girl he cheated with in some way. Then I just can’t get her image out of my mind and it sends me into a deep sadness for the rest of the day. I don’t even think of him in a romantic light anymore as I am so much better off without him (although he has left me with very many emotional scars due to the way he treated me). 
Sometimes, I’ll even laugh a certain way and my inner voice says “you sound just like her when you laugh”. Is this a normal reaction to being cheated on? It’s the first time it’s ever happened to me as he was my first real relationship. I feel like I’m going insane! I want it to stop. It’s stopping me from watching certain things or going into certain shops in town because I see someone who looks TOO MUCH like her.

Spread them and **FLY.** It takes time, as I always say, its a constant reminder that the best we can do is that in itself. Stay focused on what you are passionate about, release the noise. The noise from inside, telling yourself you aren't good enough, you can't accomplish it, you aren't worthy, as well as the noise from the external.

I have learned over the past little while though, that if there are no enemies inside then **ALL** enemies outside can't verbally, physically harm us. Its always about the internal work. Its all about how we speak to ourselves inside. I have learned the ""Delete, Delete"" Technique. In moments that we begin to speak negatively or we actually do, say **OUT LOUD, ""Delete, Delete"" &amp; then replace it with saying 2 things you love about yourself.** 

Over time this will become easier and we will be able to speak kindly to ourselves. Speak loving to ourselves the way we always speak to others. Why do we do that with everyone else? But when it comes to us, we are so quick to speak the opposite. The mind I think itself is confused with itself, I chuckled out loud writing that, because think about it. The mind is actually confused, as we are, which is truly beautiful. The mind only lives in **2 places.** The **past,** with, **dwelling;** &amp; the **future,** with the **fear** of the **unknown.** We must **be. Be Present** in the moment that we have right now, because **thats all we have.**

**Today:** Give yourself a GREAT **big hug.** For the **progress you** have made, for the **battles you** have pushed through, as well as the battles that are still happening inside. **I hear you, I am here for you. I am proud of you.**

**I love you.**

It was the most scarry place where you would get beaten with anything in the teacher's hand. But still, why good memories too, give me a severe depression?

Also, Sometimes, when I see landscape wallpapers, I also get lost in thoughts and start to feel severe depression.

I heard that when someone (mostly girls tho) have ""daddy issues"", they tend to be very sensitive, when they for example feel like their bf  texted them ""ok"" in an agressive manner or things similar to that and then they make sure everything is fine and that the guy is not mad etc. 

Bcs this is pretty much exactly what is happening to me. Whenever I feel like I said something wrong to a girl I always apologise 4000000 times and make sure that she is fine, or that I did not hurt her or anything like that.

Im also getting intrusive thoughts and nightmares that really stress me out even though I thought I’d come to terms with what the intrusive thoughts are about.

I’m worried about going to the doctor because I think they’ll tell me I’m making it up? And if they did believe me then I’d feel like I was taking medication for something I’d made up?? 

The back story on my mother is I’m also worried if I have anxiety that I’ll start becoming my mother and I try really hard to not be her and have her toxic ways. In a way it’s easy as the behaviour has repulsed me but in another way there are traits I have from living with her for 21 years; basically I’m scared to have anxiety because what if I have bipolar. 


Anyone I talk to about it laughs about it because they’re like mate, you have anxiety about having anxiety how does this not tell you you have anxiety.

Due to the current situation in the UK with coronavirus, the NHS is neglecting cancer patients and other people with less chance of survival, as well as people who are potentially waiting for a cancer diagnosis, like my mom, who has had many tumour-like growths appear on her skin. I have offered her my entire life savings for her to go private, but she has refused.

The world is a cruel place, especially now with the timing she's had to get these growths appearing all over her and the doctors and nurses are literally having to choose who gets to live and who dies due to the sheer amount of people needing medical treatment because of covid.

But for even one other person besides me to see through my dad's ugly is just so empowering and proves to ME that I wasn't imagining it. I wasn't just making excuses to dislike him. I'm done. If I get invited to the funeral nobody will like the petty speech I have planned for that asshole. I just won't go but I did create a speech for my own comfort about why I don't care about him anymore. According to my little brother our other brother has said it for years but it fell on deaf ears. The thought of that narcissistic ass and his match made in heaven narcissistic wife losing everything is such sweet validation. And my brother is in therapy and coincidentally I am also in therapy as of last week. My brother said he finally started crying after years of my dad's oppressive bs. He always told us crying is for saps and pussies. He always told us how stupid our interests are. He didn't even know me. He didn't care about what I liked  Just paraded me around because I was his daughter. Then when his shiny new prize, mistress and second wife gave him a step daughter he threw all of his kids under the bus because she is compliant and a daddy's girl. So he threw us away. I'm glad to see the manipulative turd alienate himself from his own kids. I'm glad my brothers are seeing what I've seen and suffered for years. I was gaslighted so badly. He used them all to hurt me and now they are all slowly seeing him for what he is. My little brother that had the breakthrough recently and wrote that ridiculous man off, he learned to cry, actually cry  and I'm proud of him. If you've never been told your emotions are stupid, you can't understand the release of an adult cry.

 I hope one day my other brothers see it too. I had a lot of siblings so time will tell. Some people always love their abusers and tough it out for a crumb of love. So no telling. But 3/6 ain't shabby.",mentalhealth,2021-01-20 16:05:12

I started feeling suicidal a few years ago, somehow managed to come over them and move on with my life , but for the past few months I've been falling deeper and deeper into depression which brought suicidal thoughts from time to time, I've always been able to cover up my emotions and always tried to be a cheerful gux around my friends but after some time i feel like my body got tired of it , i just faze out and think about nothing y people started noticing and now I even started considering drugs to juat take the pain away , i know that's a bad thing to consider but idk what to do anymore, i just want a hug damnit I never wanted to be like this , crying every night so my family doesn't hear me , being desperate for at least some sympathy and love .

I've had terrible luck (I call it a curse) and every so often a new traumatic terrible thing happens, without getting too detailed a therapist basically told me I have ptsd from like 4 separate events and c-ptsd from childhood. I don't function the way I see other people function and I feel immense guilt and shame. 

I finally got a job I love but they won't make accomodations so it's either stand all day (you'd be surprised how difficult this can be) or nothing, and I've been chosing to take obscene amounts of ibuprofen and commit to working through the pain. Then I got covid and even after recovering I'm so tired I can't imagine going back yet. I'm terrified of falling behind again and losing what little we have. My family is chronically homeless because I just can't seem to hold my shit together. I historically can't hold a job because of my depression and chronic illness, I'm underqualified for a desk job so I wreck my body for a few months at a time and always inevitably have to quit when I can't take anymore. I've been denied disability twice and don't have the energy to fight anymore. I tried going back to school to get qualifications and it was the happiest I've ever been but then coronavirus hit and my brain just can't do online classes, I was tanking my grades so I dropped out when I was given the option to without harming my transcripts. 

I can't keep a therapist because we have to move around so much. I checked myself in for help at the start of 2020 and was prescribed meds that made me have awful side effects and referred me to an outpatient clinic that basically did am eval and said my depression is too severe for their services and sent me on my way, no advice given on how to get off the seizure meds or anti depressants I'd been put on in the hospital with the promise of continued care, so I just stopped taking them. I haven't seen anyone since. I can't find meds that help any of my symptoms at all, and I've tried a lot. I feel like a worthless piece of garbage all the time. I dissociate and feel like I've lived entire years that are just hazy days passing by sequentially, with nothing happening. No memories or joy outside of the little bubble I have with my kids but I often feel like I'm letting them down too. I blink and a month has gone by and I've barely accomplished anything, I don't know how normal productive people have the energy to do what they do. I just want to be normal, I want to provide for my family, I want to be clean. I want stop feeling like I'm drowning when I check my emails because all my bills are past due and I don't know when I'll get paid again.

I don't know what to do to make me work. I don't usually feed in to these woe is me feelings, I try to stay positive and work as hard as I can, but I'm only in my late 20s and feel so empty and exhausted I can't see myself making it through the rest of a lifetime.",mentalhealth,2021-01-20 16:33:09

I have been ignoring it all and carrying on like normal. I slipped into a few bad habits like my sleeping pattern, which is non existent. I’ve also been skipping meals. Well what started off as skipping meals soon became not eating at all.

The pandemic has allowed me to work from my bed, as a result I didn’t get up. My problem is now, I’m at a point where I’ve done so much damage, I’m in pain when I use my muscles to do anything.
 
I’ve also noticed my body has been reduced to fat. Naturally I have a firm body and didn’t worry too much about exercising because I’m pretty active. I would go do yoga, cycle and swim. I also used to walk whenever I could. Now my body is very soft, I can feel fat with hardly any muscle.

I think because the absence of my muscles makes it hard to move properly (it’s weird to explain). When I do attempt to move properly I’m in a lot of pain and my body aches. 

I started with trying to wean myself back into eating but I keep throwing up. All I do is drink sugary drinks, tea and water so I can at least function. Sometimes I might eat some fruit but that’s about it.

Since eating wasn’t working, I tried doing a light workout today and had to stop because I couldn’t lift my legs at all. My whole body was trembling. I can’t sit up straight so I have to lay down constantly. My biceps hurt so much and I’m only noticing now that I’ve attempted to use them.",mentalhealth,2021-01-20 16:34:24

Or even if it’s a cis person i just think about saying/doing toxic stuff (for example saying to a guy that crying is weak, even tho I don’t believe that). 

I don’t know why i do that, i try every day to be the most respectful i can, and I’m a huge advocate for lgbtq (I also am lgbtq) and I’m a feminist and i believe in equality, but every time i have these thoughts i’m afraid that I’m a fraud and I’m actually an evil person.

I wanted to know if anybody experiences similar things, one way I cope is every time i get these kind of thoughts i have to say (in my head) phrases with the right pronouns or phrases that are more in agreement with my morals (for example saying that crying is not weak and men should be free to express themselves)

I'll try to describe it, maybe someone who has some more experience could tell me what it is.

Every time I do something where I feel even moderately good/do something amongst others like for example joking with my classmates during online class, I end up feeling completely empty afterwards, sometimes this feeling even comes close to being devastated. Unfortunately, I can't really go into myself and see why it is like this, but a possible reason could be that I think I ""wasted"" my good words or things I directly or indirectly said (about myself). The reason why I think so is because I for example feel like this when I send a picture I really like to someone or tell them something I'm more or less passionate about and they respond with ""ok"" or ""cool"" or ignore me. Honestly, ignoring is the worst thing, my biggest fear.

This feeling that follows is like a mix of ""It's ok, you learned that you just shouldn't show anything of yourself, people don't care"", frustration and regretting what I did.

For instance, I had this feeling for the first time when I first went to a dance class. This was one of the more extreme cases. It was kind of fun and I did something in front of the people, I still was very insecure and felt like I had to go home the whole time. But as I got home, I thought about how bad I was, especially in comparison to the other people there. This physical sadness as I call it (this feeling where you feel your worries under your eyeballs, I also don't really know) took over me and I didn't really feel/think about anything but at the same I indirectly thought I would never go out again and all that typical stuff. Then I started to cry and try to suppress this feeling.

I always blame it on my age since I'm in my teenage years, but now I'm kind of frightened that it will always stay a part of me. I'm sorry if you didn't really understand my weird vent, I don't think would've been able to. It's my first time talking about mental health on reddit/my mental health on the internet and I'm just not good at writing in general (and English I must add).

This will probably be a story to long for you to read. I'll be frank with you, I have never experienced anything traumatic in my life, I have no origin story to my sadness, I have no reason to be depressed and I sure as hell can't keep people interested as I write this text. But I want advice. Let me tell you a little about myself so you know where I come from. I am a boy, 15 years old(almost 16, I say like a small child holding up their fingers) and I live in the Netherlands, a perfectly fine country. I've been watching TV, Netflix, films and anime since I was an infant. I've always admired any protagonist in any story and I have always had the desire to copy them, sometimes I wasn't even aware of it. This is pretty common around kids, but with me, it never faded. I have no identity, I have no personality, I only recently realized I am just a white piece of paper. I never really fitted in anyway, I am a person of colour, which is not a big problem in my country. But it does make you feel like an outsider and often that is the case, especially when you're young and in school. I skipped two years of school and people have high expectations of me but I have 0 attention span and motivation. Since I don't know who I am as a person I, of course, have no idea what I like and what I want to study and stuff. But anyway back to the story. I've been copying people since I was a small human. And this was serious copying, everything in my behavior changed, I bought similar clothing styles, got interested in similar stuff and was thinking like those protagonists. I hate myself. A few of the people I've copied are: Sherlock Holmes, Gregory house, kuroko from kuroko no basuke, killua from hxh, yugi from yugioh and about 300 more of these people. I've been doing this since I was a small child so I have no idea who I really am, I can't stop it, I do always notice it and I have no idea what my personality is like. I hate myself because I don't like the way I look, I don't like the fact that I can't be beautiful like the people is shows, that my emotions aren't as beautifully and clearly portrayed on my face and that my real face can't even convey most of those emotions the way I feel them. I just hate myself. I've cut myself, I've beaten myself, nothing special for this reddit page probably. I've also lied, a lot. It's like a chain around my heart and most of my lies I can't unravel anymore. I'm just stuck in this skintight container and I can't breathe, I can't move, I can't do anything except reusing my habits. I don't have a goal in life, I have no reason to get out of bed, I don't have real friends, I don't have a girlfriend(even though I long for one so so much). I don't have anything. The character I felt closest to in all of my life was kaneki ken from Tokyo ghoul. He's basically me, is what'd Im saying right now. Even though I don't know that for sure. I don't even have the attention span to read a book without having to reread every sentence. Sometimes I read entire chapters and I think to myself, wait what did I just read. Like I had read none of it, I would remember none of it anyway. I don't know whether I'm introverted or extraverted, I don't know if I like to be alone or not, if I'm a leader or not, if I'm passionate or not. I don't even know my gender, that's right. I don't. I have been thinking I was transgender since I was 12 years old. But I don't know. My feelings about this fluctuate all the time, the strength too. I can't go one way because I'll get pulled the other anyway. I'm all alone in life, thinking why am I wasting my life like this. I want memories, adventure, something I'm good at, activities I like, a job I want, just a goal to live for. But I have nothing. I am nothing. I don't know what to do. Every second I live in regret of what I could have been or maybe should be. There is nothing in my life I like. Absolutely nothing. I have tried out so many things, I listen to music all the time, yet I don't have the motivation to learn an instrument. I have watched tons of doctor shows and I think I like it and would be good at it, but I suck at studying. I get bored very easily and never really have fun. I want my life to be simpler. I want it to give me memories and stuff. I have been at the edge of suicide for a long time as well, but I don't see the point. I would call myself optimistic but I don't know what the future bears. I know everything is relative and change is always right around the corner, that's why I don't suicide. I don't even know why I'm telling u all this, I'm sorry to disappoint, there simply is no point to this story. I am the definition of a identity crisis. Please help me. Give me an identity. Help me find myself. I don't care just help me in any way possible. I get nauseated by the thought of sitting behind a TV or my phone basically unconscious, all turned off for another minute. I can't stand it anymore. I want to fucking live. One thing, I have a chronic unknown issue in my side, I get severe pain and attacks if I get stressed or something. Noone knows what it is, but It has given me a lot of fear. I want to get rid of that fear mostly.

Tldr: I have no identity and personality, I don't know my gender, personality, goal in life, etc. I can't stand it anymore. Someone help me find myself, please. Btw I do not have memory loss etc, I just suck at life.

I am fundraising for the sake of my sister, Mahara Santos. Mahara is 16 years-old. She's a very kind and creative kid with lots of promise. Mahara and I are Filipino immigrants looking for a better life in the USA. We were brought here by our single mother, who works as a registered nurse.

Mahara and I have suffered through physical and emotional abuse throughout our childhood that only recently stopped. She got sent to the mental hospital early December of 2020 after CPS came to our house to investigate our situation after I had emailed my teacher about it and our suicidal tendencies. We were both sent to the ER but she was doing far worse than me. So, she was admitted to the mental hospital. Besides witnessing the abuse inflicted to me first-hand, she had experienced it herself. This took a huge toll on her mental health. She did not feel safe at home with my mom so she stayed in the mental hospital for a while. She was diagnosed with manic depression, PTSD, and schizophrenia caused by her trauma and abuse.

When she got home, she was doing a lot better and was finally looking forward to things. My mom, who was abusive to us, was finally taking steps to get better. But we didn't anticipate the effects of the bills waiting for us. We thought the future was finally shining at least a little bit brighter for us, but it became more difficult to see that after seeing our mom struggle with our finances. Mahara was scared that mom would revert back to her old abusive behavior and start blaming all of the suffering she has to endure on us, despite us being victims of her abuse. Mahara wants a new start, but we feel that these financial burdens are just reminders of the shackles that held her down.

Being young immigrants, we're trying to make the best of our situation right now but it is very difficult. So, I hope you could be able to find it in your hearts to donate even just a small amount of money to pay her bills.

The funds raised will be used exclusively for Mahara's medical bills and will go through me, to assure my mother doesn't use it for anything else but Mahara's needs.

I would be eternally grateful if you could help me give my sister a chance at getting a better life. Thank you so much for taking the time to read this and helping us. Sharing this around would help a lot also.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm a 22-year-old semi-recent graduate (April 2020) and have been trying to navigate my way through life in "" \*\*\*The Real World\*\*\* "". I've always considered myself to not be mentally stable as I had a lot of trauma growing up as a kid with my family along with having a really pisspoor way of dealing with my own personal problems. I had always just been able to push those issues aside and take life one step at a time, but that's not really working anymore and I've found myself in a rut for the past few months without knowing how to get myself out.

&amp;#x200B;

Backstory time; I studied Architectural Technology for 4 years and had a decent understanding of where I'd want to take my career in said field. I met some really good hearted and like-minded people along the way and even met someone who I consider to be one of (if not) my best friends. I've worked for some hospital facilities planning departments and even under the federal government through co-op's and did pretty well from what my bosses have told me and wrote in their letters of recommendation. After graduating I found a project coordination position in my home town with a well respected family-owned construction company. The people I worked with were lovely and treated me like family but the nature of the business was very stress-inducing, to say the least. Along with being the only person in my field working there excluding my boss (the rest were interior designers) as well as being extremely busy with people diverting their vacation fund to upgrading their house due to the pandemic, it wasn't really an optimal place for a new grad to work. Have you ever had that constant weight on your chest from anxiety and fear? That's basically what I was dealing with for the 4 months I was working there. Stress and doubt started to accrue on whether the I was capable of this position. When I actually managed to pull off impressive tasks, I wouldn't really get that value of gratification of being told ""Hey, you did a really good job on that project!"". Instead, my mind decided to focus on the negatives of what happened there (i.e. messing up a quote,). These negatives started out small in number but I just ended up having my attention focused on them, which in turn caused me to make more of them. Then the small mistakes turned into not so small mistakes. The not so small mistakes turned into, ""Woah what happened here"" mistakes. Eventually, it got to a point where my boss seemed to notice there was something wrong and pulled me aside to talk about it. After making a \*\*very\*\* big mistake, I was given two options on how to continue. Option one was to take things back and start fresh with the caveat of having a lot of work to do as they were insanely busy. Option two walk away from the position and focus on myself. It was clear that without me the company would be ""In a hole that I dug them in"" but he assured me that with or without me they'll get through it. I ended up taking option two and left. My boss was very professional about the whole situation and offered me some advice on how to move forward. Like I said, as much as I hated the nature of the work, I absolutely loved the people I worked with; I just think I didn't deal with the issues I was having at work until it was too late and it all ended up blowing up in my face when I should have dealt with it at the start.

&amp;#x200B;

Fast forward to now; it's been about four months since this all went down. At the start, I honestly felt a lot less stressed and decided to have a bit of a break from everything and just unwind. Better it happen during a pandemic where I get to use that as an excuse right? Thing is, I realized after a few days that I wasn't happy and I've been too occupied with life and what not to realize it. Nothing that used to bring me joy does it anymore, I preferred spending my free time during the night versus the day when I had time off and wanted to sleep and stay in my bedroom for as long as possible on weekends. Activities I used to enjoy like videogames, reading, sketching and piano just seemed like a chore. I get irritated very easily and my relationship with my family (mainly my mother and brother) has deteriorated to a point where it's hard to communicate with them anymore. I've felt this way for a very long time (around 2 years now) but never really questioned it because I was so busy with school and co-op. Now that I'm not working and not in school anymore, everything just hit me like a brick wall and I have no idea how to move forward. I went from being someone who was considered to be a natural-born leader who people could rely on to just some kid who can't help himself with his problems. To say I'm depressed about this entire situation is an understatement and the state of the world isn't helping my case one bit (Ontario just went into its second province-wide shutdown). I know that I'm not the only one going through a rough time at the moment and that people are able to get themselves out of these situations. I'm just wondering where do I go from here. I have no idea about to get myself help when it comes to mental health or the resources that are available to me.

TL;DR - I pushed my problems away and had a catalyst event where everything just blew up in my face and I'm dealing with the negative repercussions of bottling everything up. Not happy and don't know how to make myself happy anymore. Trying to find help but have no idea how to go about it.",mentalhealth,2021-01-20 17:16:59

Also it happens when I read in front of people. For example I once read something to a friend and I didn't feel any chest pain or lack of breath, but when I tried to read something in front of the class, I started, it was okay and then ten seconds later my chest starts beating and I am having lack of breath, and I can't even control it and only after I read it, I have to wait about ten minutes before the pain goes away, Is there anyway I could be better at these stuff without feeling that pain?

This is long sorry.

I dont know for sure what I 'have but I feel burnt out by my own thoughts and am struggling to function properly, though i think from the outside I seem fine. I experience quite sudden and severe pangs of anxiety, mainly at work, when I have to go speak to people I dont really know or take calls when someone else is in the room with me. It just drives the anxious side of my brain crazy and I have a really hard time doing these simple things which other people seem to do with ease. 

I think my social anxiety has gotten worse since I started working full time and I think its stopping me from getting to know people properly. I feel like i never really know what to say to anyone and I dread being caught in conversations with people I dont really know, even if id like to get to know them better. With lockdown, I've started to lose a sense of time and i sometimes feel disorientated, like ibe been at work for days on end and havent left. I've been waking up a lot in the night to check my alarm is on, which is new for me, and it's like my body or mind doesn't really know what time it is. Its quite disorientating and a bit scary. I know this is due to the lockdown and monotony of day to day life, but i haven't experienced this feeling of confusion before. My brain feels foggy and I find it really hard to concentrate.

Don't get me wrong, I do talk to people at work and with the ones I'm more used to, I find it quite easy to just talk freely. I dont think I lack inherent social skills but its the fear of being scrutinised and judged that makes it difficult for me to interact in group settings. I do much better around smaller groups of people and am most content when I'm just sat with one person at a time. Would this be classed as simple introversion or a sign of social phobia? Thankfully I'm not in a job where I have to be outgoing, but there will come a time when I have to be less 'shy' and the thought is terrifying. I have this fear other people know what I'm thinking and can somehow read my mind and will know im scared or anxious. Which equals weakness, and will make them think less of me. I hate the thought of someone being able to pick up on my discomfort and i just wish i could feel at ease. I feel like people get confused by my interactions because some days I'm pretty chatty and then withdrawn the next. Some days are better than others

Hey.

I would really like your opinion/thought on what happened to me.

something happened to me, and I really don't have a clue what it could have been.

so, about 10 days ago I was just playing a PC game, while I was talking to my friend

I was having a really good time, but then after maybe 1-2 hours of playing, I just got this feeling out of nowhere.

the first detail that happened to me was that I got this really weird feeling in my body, I have a really hard time explaining this feeling,

it's like I'm almost losing control of reality, but at the same time I know exactly what is happening, I could still play the game, (I probably did not focus at the game that good tho.)

and I still had a conversation with my buddy. But I felt REALLY sick, it was the worst feeling ever in my body, (not that I felt nauseous). At the same time I could almost hear a nasty voice inside my head, also got a lot of anxiety (i would say) Still had a conversation with my friend, about something in the game,

but that did not help me from having this feeling. I also got a bit sweaty on my neck. At some point, I actually thought I was about to lose control and go crazy

I guess I was scared that the feeling would not let go of me, which it did after 15-20 minutes.

I've been searching around on the internet, but the only thing I can find is ""panic attacks"" some symptoms fit in very well about what was happening, for example, Fear of loss of control, Sweating, Feeling of unreality or detachment, and Hot flashes.

but I really don't know if it was a panic attack/anxiety attack? This happened again like the next day, or the next day after that. But has not happened since then.

(other than that the exact same feeling in my body almost hit me again like yesterday, but disappeared after like 1 minute.)

But I can't stop thinking about what happened to me. And also I kind of recognize that feeling I got in my body because of that nasty feeling I'm very sure I've felt when I was a little kid about (10-12 years old) I'm 18 now.",mentalhealth,2021-01-20 17:42:18

The pandemic was taking a toll, and I tried to find a therapist that takes my insurance and couldn't get any to call me back. I decided to start listing all the people who make a difference in my life, from family members to co-workers to neighbors I don't know well but I observe them picking up trash or doing thoughtful things. Making the list was a huge boost to my spirts, especially when I thought about how many of them are still healthy and OK despite Covid.  


I then made cards to send to each person on the list, telling them what I liked about them and what I was grateful for. I tried to focus on their good qualities, and what I admire. That lifted my spirits even more! I realized what wealth I have in my life: people who have qualities and skills and histories and stories that are really special. Then I mailed the cards, and started getting responses. People told me how my card was the highlight of the year for them, or how my card made them cry. One friend told me she rereads it and repeats the words to herself when she is feeling down. Some people wrote really nice letters back about me. It was amazing. I can't believe how much this has helped. Its been several months now and my mindset is in just such a different place, even though things are still hard.

Growing up as a kid/early teen I didn’t brush my teeth as often as I should’ve due to lack of energy or because I was constantly eating and didn’t want to deal with the taste of tooth paste in my mouth, which yes I realize is gross. I also ate A LOT of sugar and junk food, as well as drank of a lot of soda. 

As I got older I started to become more depressed and just stopped caring about my health altogether. I stopped brushing completely and was eating worse and worse. As a kid I would get my teeth fixed because my parents were responsible for taking me to the dentist but once it became my responsibility I got too nervous to make appointments and my depression made me lack motivation to want to get help. 

I ended up developing periodontitis disease after having a tooth infection that I left unfixed and am still continuing to leave unfixed because I don’t have the money to get my teeth done right now and it’s only getting worse because I continue to eat the same junk. 

I’m the most depressed I’ve ever been. I use to be beautiful but now I cry every time I look in the mirror. My face is all deformed because the disease is eating away at my gums and bones. I can get antibiotics but that isn’t going to fix the way my face looks.

it's only been a year or two since i've realized that my mental health is... *really really bad.* i've sort of repressed it for years, because being ""quiet"" has always been what's kept me safest. repression doesn't really work anymore, so now i'm all kinds of messy. but i've also been taught no coping skills, and am bad at taking help. i'm even worse at giving it to myself.

i know that there's things like mindfulness, and journaling, and changing my sleep schedule, but that all feels like it'd do so little. i feel like there's a bigger problem that needs to be dealt with before i can get to those, but i almost can't identify it.

i feel like there's too much for some strangers on the internet to pinpoint what would be best to help me, and i feel bad saying that i'm not sure what would either. but i don't really have anywhere else to go to ask... a *general audience,* i guess. my parents aren't supportive, and i think i'd get into more trouble than it's worth trying to ask for help, professional or not.

i guess this is a question of... what do i do? what can i do?

I have been having this really strong urges to just end it all because i feel like the world would be better without me. I am the eldest of 5 kids. I am the only one who has graduated. My siblings are all still studying. My dad's a deadbeat but he's a kind guy. Problem is he values his friends above everything else. I once told him that his friend groped me and his response was that it was okay because i was flat chested and had nothing that could be groped. He said sorry after and tried to pass it off as a joke but i'll never forget it. He doesn't like violence as a form of punishment but he has slapped me once because i called him stupid for making my boyfriend stay out late despite us having classes tomorrow morning (they were friends before we started dating). I am the only one he has ever laid hands on. I forgave him for this after a long time but its still something ill never forget. My mom is our breadwinner. She works really hard for us which is why i felt bad when i realized how horrible her parenting was when it came to punishments. She was really violent. From hitting us to drowning us whenever we did anything bad. She basically raised us herself so deep down i understand how she could make mistakes but i hate how much her punishments normalized violence in us. When i graduated college, i started playing a bigger role when it came to our family's expenses. I would repeatedly tell my mom to save or to only buy what we need. She hates this and sometimes would be annoyed at me for reminding here again and again. I feel like a bad guy for doing this but i know we need it cause we have no savings and our budget's a mess. Im also the one that says no and talks to my siblings when it comes to going out or when they ask my mom to buy them things i know we can't afford. Playing the bad or strict one in the family has taken a toll on my mental health but i know someone has to do it. I am also in a 7 year relationship which is going good. He feels like a good friend to me. However i feel that the support is just a one way thing. I feel that when im weak the relationship crumbles as i cant rely on him. We also have this fights whenever we get drunk that escalates really quick. Although it happens rarely like maybe once a year it gets too big that its hard to forget. He's really scandalous (which triggers me as i have anxiety in public or things being shown in public). He also gets verbally aggressive. Its not like im a good person because when this fights happen and i get triggered i would hit him. I hate myself for doing this. We havent broken up as we would always promise to change this and we would be healthy for a while but then it happens again. I hate how toxic i am to everyone around me. I hate how many times i hear voices telling me how horrible i am and how i should just end it and i hate how i know they are right.",mentalhealth,2021-01-20 18:23:21

I feel like if I fail then death seems like a preferable alternative to having to deal with my parents, and the consequences of the failure, however I know this is not the best way to deal with failure, so I figured I'd ask for ideas here.

i have now started having panic attacks, and i’m like actually too scared to go to some of my lessons now in case i get asked something. so now instead of probably having depression we now have a sprinkling of anxiety which is so fun. 

and now my parents have decided that even after i told them that quite a few of my teachers suggested that i see a councillor that they would take it into their own hands. (btw i live in the uk so counselling is free so it’s not about money). my dad came and spoke to me today acting like he’s some kind of therapist (trust he is nothing like a therapist). my dad’s advice was ... wait for it ... just don’t feel like that!!????? i mean thank you for the amazing advice so helpful. 

when i pointed out that that advice wasn’t too great he then got angry at me and called me selfish and that i never think about other people and only think about myself. (i think my lack of thinking about myself is probably one of the reasons for this whole situation because i’ve never spoken to anyone about myself and am more of a listener than a talker because i don’t like being a burden). like another big thing of mine is just feeling incredibly guilty anyway for feeling like this so my dad says no that really didn’t help. 

i then complained to my mum and she was just as bad, telling me that i just needed to breath. like i understand where she’s coming from but when i’m hyperventilating, chocking, feeling like i’m watching myself etc. it’s quite hard to ‘just breath’. also my mum doesn’t take my panic attacks seriously. when emailing one of my teachers she said i had a ‘weepy wobble’ and told me not to use the word panic attack but say i was feeling ‘really strange’. 

idk what to do anymore, i’ve tried speaking to them and they’ve done absolutely nothing. i’ve even said that it’s been suggested that i see a councillor so can i and they’re just like nahhh it’s not serious enough. i thought after emailing my mum about how my mental health has been rapidly declining that they may take it seriously.

I'm not showing anything but I'd be okay with adding it, or even removing some details or the post itself since these are really awful things).

Now, I don't want to go into too much detail in case this is like, too dark, but I'm genuinely starting to worry some things I've seen online have had an adverse effect on my already bad mental health.

I've always been paranoid, my brain would play disturbing and graphic scenarios of events that could happen, but I definitely think some things I've seen online have worsened it.

I'd say early last year, maybe late 2019, I was just scrolling online and came across a news article. Me being the curious kid I am, I click on it, not expecting to see some guy's face getting ripped off by a tree and I was horrified, but got over it after a few hours.

Fast forward to June 2020, Pride month, and I just had to get myself involved in fighting against Pride fall. If you didn't know, Pride fall was an online trolling event, and an attack on the LGBTQ+. It seemed some people were getting doxxed due to it, and me, once again, being curious as heck, just had to look at the videos on my Instagram feed, I know I shouldn't have but I did, and with some of them I didn't even have a choice since Instagram didn't censor them despite how graphic they were. I saw videos of LGBTQ+ people getting assaulted, a goat getting it's head whacked off with a club, a 14-year-old having his throat slit open, someone crying on the floor being held hostage with both arms chopped off, and someone getting beheaded. For the entirety of June I couldn't sleep at night, I had to use a VPN 24/7, I would lay awake in my bed thinking somebody was going to torture me to death and laugh, it scared me. It took me a while to get over this, I just had to distract myself and hope I could keep it out of my head.

Until recently I hadn't seen anything graphic online for a while, I avoided that stuff and only ever watched something kinda dark if it wasn't real, mainly South Park since I can handle cartoon violence and dark humor. But the memories resurfaced a few days ago and really messed me up, and today a Pride Discord server I was in had somebody ping the entire server with just a plain video. I forgot this was a WIP server and assumed it was one of the mods since in most servers regular members don't have the permission to do that, but without thinking I clicked on the video,, that same dreaded video of somebody getting their head chopped off I saw last Pride month, which got me to break into tears, I wasn't mentally prepared to see that again, and even with preparation it's absolutely horrifying.

I'm starting to wonder if that stuff had a long term effect on me without me realizing it, because I often see really bad scenarios in my head, way worse than before. I've imagined accidents I could be in and ways I could die, what my corpse looks like, I have a lot of bad habits like banging my head on objects, and I was doing this while failing to focus on school work and suddenly the image of my head being caved in popped into my mind as a possible outcome. I've imagined my limbs being sliced up, my eyes and teeth being pulled out, last time I went to a grocery store I was convinced I was about to get stabbed and die. My mental health hasn't been great since, like, 5th grade, but this stuff might've scarred me and I was wondering if it could have any significant effects on me mentally. I mean, I'm only turning 14-years-old next month, man, I'm pretty sure I'm too young to have seen any of this stuff, let alone a handful or more of it, and then the fear and threats of being doxxed and attacked for being LGBTQ+ as well? I'm kind of worried that this is really...bad for my brain??

I'm really sorry for going so in-depth, I'm really okay with removing this if it's too much, and I'm so sorry if I freaked anybody out and there wasn't enough warning at the beginning!",mentalhealth,2021-01-20 19:06:09

I’m writing here because I don’t know what to do anymore, I feel like so many things are wrong with me but I don’t even know what it could be or how to start figuring that out. Could anyone please read and direct me in any direction of finding out what is possibly wrong

So to start with, I’m really impulsive for example I always argue with my managers at work and get sent home and I’ve even quit on the spot many times before, I don’t think before I speak or act it just feels like it happens and I’m just watching. I also get impulsive in the sense that If I want to do something I need to do it right then and I don’t think that through, for example I saw a job sign and wanted to go and ask about it but my boyfriend drove past and I started crying uncontrollably because I felt like I HAD to go ask there and then otherwise it would be gone, this felt silly afterwards. This is similar in personal relationships, in arguments I always get tunnel vision and I find it hard to see things in a balanced way for example if my boyfriend does something that hurts me I find it impossible to understand that he still loves me in that moment and it just feels like he’s a bad person etc but when everything is good I find it hard to think that he could do anything wrong 

Leading on from that I’m really sensitive and cry almost every day over small things because everything seems to overwhelm me for example if I can’t find something in my room or if everything is too messy which it usually is. I’m also sensitive in relationship for example I always question whether people love me and think I’ll end up alone which makes me act crazy.

 I go through a lot of intense mood swings every day. For example I can go from laughing to being really angry and sometimes even feel suicidal for a few moments and then it all seems silly because I feel fine after. On top of the changes during the day, there’s some bigger swings between different days and weeks, I either feel like I’m doing absolutely nothing and I wake up in the afternoon and stay in bed or I try to do everything perfectly and wake up at 5am and workout and eat healthy, I feel like there’s no in between. This is frustrating because I can’t seem to allow myself find a balance, for example if I’m trying to be productive and good and I allow myself to have something unhealthy or dont strictly stick to my routine I immediately switch and become a complete slob again at least for that whole day.

I feel like I don’t know who I am sometimes, I don’t know what my personality is and I feel like I just adjust it based on who I’m with but other than that I just feel like I’m blank.

I also feel like I can’t seem to maintain many close relationships because the thought of communicating with people every day or doing small things like texting overwhelms me so I end up ignoring them for weeks and then feeling guilty and even worse because I feel lonely. 

Every day life just seems too much and I don’t understand why because I try to get organised and I make lists of what I should do but I never seem to finish and I can’t really stay focused, because of this I leave all my uni assignments until last minute, even though I always complete them and do well in the end the habit of leaving it so late makes me feel constantly stressed. Even though I can’t get anything done it feels like I’m always doing something but nothing ever gets done which is frustrating because I don’t feel like I ever relax but I’m not getting anything done either. 

I’m sorry for this rant I just don’t know where to start and my GP keeps dismissing me and it’s especially hard to get an appointment now",mentalhealth,2021-01-20 19:07:00

I was promoted to a manager role and have since struggled immensely with trying to stay on top of everything. It's the most responsibility I've ever had and also the highest salary I've made by quite a bit. Over time, I've lost all motivation and barely do anything in my job anymore and am just constantly getting further behind. I cry on Sunday nights dreading the next day when I go back to work. I have missed deadlines and feel like I'm a completely different person that I don't recognize compared to who I was in school and previous jobs. Add in the pandemic and political issues in my country (US) and it's been a really tough year all around. I have depression and anxiety and both of those have gotten substantially worse throughout all this, where I feel like I don't do anything well anymore, including outside of work. 

After giving my notice, my supervisor basically told me I'm letting my depression control my life and asked me to reconsider either staying in my position longer, or taking a demotion to remove the manager responsibilities from my plate. I'm truly doubting if I'm making the right decision by leaving. I keep trying to remind myself that no job is worth sacrificing my mental health, but what if the major problem is just my own issues and the job isn't the problem? I just feel so confused.

I have been taking 600mg of St Johns Wort daily since the 14th of July (so about 6 months) as I was experiencing really bad anxiety and depression. I had about 4 panic attacks in the span for a few months, and I was having suicidal thoughts and hopelessness fairly often, especially when I drank. I have struggled with mental health in the past, I have had social anxiety for most my life, and have experienced low moods although have only been depressed once I believe. But I have never taken medication for it and have never really had ""proper"" anxiety. I had experienced panic attacks before this, they just happened rarely. 

Well, at the time of all this covid was bad, I had moved cities + house, had to get a new job, and was obviously inside most of he time, specifically stuck in one room of a flat share. So, yeah, not the best combo for someone who's prone to becoming anxious or depressed under stress. Well, I have been feeling a bit better for a little while now, however particularly since December as me and my partner moved in together and I have started a course which will allow me to go to university next year. So, I am a lot more stable in life and have not been experiencing much anxiety or sadness. I have also recently started taking care of my physical health by working out and eating healthy.

So basically, I don't FEEL like I need to take the medication anymore, however I would assume that a working medication might make you feel this way too? Either way, 1 week ago I decided that I wanted to start coming off of it. I have been taking two tablets a day, so this week I have been taking only 1 1/2. I think the first 2-3 days I didn't notice anything, and then one day I randomly got this very strange lightheadedness. That kind of thing gives me anxiety, so it nearly sent me into a panic attack, but I was able to calm myself down and the whole thing only lasted like 5 minutes max. Since then I have been feeling mild dissociating anxiety. I haven't BEEN dissociating, but I have been feeling like I will thus giving me a weird anxiety feeling, however I haven't had any proper anxiety. It's mainly just been little moments. Also, I used to struggle with body dysmorphia, however I have not struggled with it for a while. But, it does tend to act up when I am depressed, stressed, or on my period. Today I was feeling really shit about how I looked in the way that I did when I was struggling with it.

So, is this normal? Or does this mean I should keep taking the medication? I really don't want to take it anymore. I genuinely feel like I am more in control of my anxiety now, I am very good as dealing with the rare panic attacks or anxiety I have. I was going to start taking 1 tablet tomorrow for 2 weeks, but I am going to wait another week until I go down to 1 tablet instead now. Unless someone tells me that these ""side effects"" are not normal?

TL;DR I started taking St Johns Wort 6 months ago when I was anxious and depressed. The past 1-2 months I have not felt like I need to take it anymore. I have been taking 3/4 of my usual dose for a week, and want to go down by 1/4 every 2 weeks until I'm not taking it anymore. In this week I have nearly had a panic attack (but calmed myself down very quickly), have had very mild anxiety since that, and also had low mood today. Is this a sign that I should keep taking the medication, or are these symptoms normal?",mentalhealth,2021-01-20 19:19:27

As pathetic as this sounds please don't judge me.   
Back story : I was dating a guy for a month and it was amazing. EVERYTHING WAS AMAZING, he bought me flowers, introduced me to his mom, took me out all the time, added himself to my schedule. Said he will do everything in his power to make sure we are together. He showed me love, he did everything with love. He wanted to meet my family but I just was never fully ready. And now that I think about it, he said he knew he was in love with me after the second date. Do I love him? No I don't think so. I think I was in love with the idea that someone could possibly love me. He did get jealous some times, and when I found out his parents had covid I suggested we don't see each other for some time just to be safe. He definitely did not like that answer and felt I was being unfair and being unreliable. But he said he is just in love and doesn't want to go through life without each other.  
We enjoyed our time together one night, it was a perfect night. Walked around town, he wanted to look at houses. He wanted to enjoy dinner and we did some work and then the next morning his tone shifted. I asked what was wrong and he got very upset. Said we don't need to see eachother every day, said we need to be healthy and this is turning into a toxic relationship. Said I need to be my own person and be happy with or without him. I am so confused, he later expressed he is dealing with depression. However after our conversation he has not responded to my text messages, he has not returned any of my phone calls. I was very nervous at first but I see he is active on social media. So I am assuming this is where it ends. I feel very lost and it triggers my abandonment issues. I told him early on that I struggle with anxiety and this triggered my mental health significantly.   


I am hurt. I been crying and felt the urge to do a bad thing, and take my life. I thought for once there was a possibility someone can love me, but obviously not. I feel like I am incapable of being loved by a significant other. I thought I was better, and as I get older, I wonder will I deal with this my entire life. It begins to feel like too much. Like I cant do this anymore. I wanted to just getaway and go to a place where worry does not exist. But I did not act on anything, but my mind is still very much near that place. I have never done this before, but after reading so many of your stories I felt like maybe I can share a little bit of mine.

I (33F) lost my pet cockatiel 17 days ago. I'm not handling it well. 

He was the first pet in my life, and I had many, that I had this extreme close connection with, like a soulmate with feathers. The last month of his life was spent in great pain despite my desperate attempts to heal him. (He burned his legs which got infected, prescribed painkillers, lotions and antibiotics did not work)

Now, after his passing, it feels like I'm slowly but surely am losing my mind. I see every item in the house and think 'I bought this when he was still alive' or 'I wish I could go back to when I got this, then he would still be here'. I am torturing myself and I just can't seem to stop. It's like I'm systematically trying to find that one item, or one memory that would cause me to wake up and realize it was all just a big long nightmare. 

I've never been good with other people, I've been relentlessly bullied until I left secondary school thus I've always stuck to animals. They seem to accept me and never judge me. My cockatiel and I fell in love immediately and not even with my bf of 12 years have I felt a connection this close. 

It's like a piece of me is missing. My mind knows he's gone and he's never coming back but every fiber in my body and soul seems to think, almost know that if I just hang on to everything he's ever touched, everything I ever bought him, there might be a chance he will return. It's literally driving me insane. 

As for real life counseling, there are almost none where I live who are specialized in grieving over pets. The ones that are are extremely expensive. The few friends that I have let me talk about him only once but never cared to ask how I'm feeling. My boyfriend lets me vent and cry, however I more and more get the feeling he wants me to get over it. 

Is there anything I can do to make me snap out of it? I miss him so bad that death would be welcomed. I am not suicidal, I've been diagnosed with depression since the age of 12 and this never changed. I had my moments but always got over it with the help of my boyfriend. It's just that my own acceptance of death has grown. It means that either I'll get to join him, or that I'll be caught in a blissful abyss of nothingness. 

This whole situation is becoming an obsession. Even dedicated chatrooms for pet loss are shying away from me with how I express my grief.

I have a tendency to lose myself in other people and interactions to the point where I feel unable to assert my will upon situations I'm in. There are a couple of key relationships in my life that don't really feel as though they are in my favor. I'm aware the easy thing to do would be to leave these relationships but I know I shouldn't just cut and run at this time, in part because I'm aware that I use avoidance as a strategy for dealing with unfavorable situations and I'm looking to become more assertive and cooperative. 

I've found avoiding situations and people works but only to an extent and I realize that my inability to be confrontational about how I feel with other people can often times be part of the problem. One problem I'm having in particular is people I work with see me as a problem solving type of person with the technical know-how to make certain things happen and it's really frustrating because I've been put in positions where I've had to make up for peoples' deficiencies and make up for the lack of someone else's knowledge which is hard, especially when that person is in a higher position than you....

Anyway, if anyone has any advice for how to be assertive in these types of situations that would be appreciated. I tend to avoid and over-correct later and instead I'm looking to be more direct about my needs and stuff like that.",mentalhealth,2021-01-20 20:06:58

Nope. Told me to end myself.,"Bit of a rant.

 So my mum likes to think she is a good listener and someone you can approach when you're feeling depressed. She likes to think either myself or my dad would open up to her and she'd actively listen. But while talking to her about that, mum says it annoys her that she didn't know dad was depressed until she went through his work diary and discovered he wrote about how depressed he was truly feeling (the entry was already a year old) and she tells me it annoys her when dad doesn't open up to her. Then proceeded to say ""I told him, Just fucking tell me what's wrong!"" and I told her that maybe her attitude and choosing to get angry is the reason dad chooses to not tell her.

I then told her about 2012 when I tried to kill myself multiple times (until yesterday she only thought it was once) and how despite having 200 pills in my stomach she looked me in my eyes while I was laying in my bed and told me to ""just do it then"". She then genuinely told me that I didn't take 200 pills. I explained how I took all of my Cocodamol and Codeine pills left over from Surgery, about 60 altogether and then stole all the paracetamol and ibuprofen in the house. Definitely over 200 pills. She then had the AUDACITY to tell me that if she knew that she would have called an ambulance and not told me to just kill myself.

She said that if I was feeling so depressed why didn't I try talking to her? I told her I did, for WEEKS I tried to talk to her. For weeks I was planning how to do it, and for weeks I was trying to ask her for help. But every time I tried having that conversation she gaslighted me by saying ""you're not depressed, you just need to get out the house and go do something"" and even after telling her my experience yesterday she still proceeded to gaslight me about it by saying she doesn't remember me trying to talk to her about it 9 years ago.

She finally gave in and kinda accepted she failed back then and gave me the weakest apology. So I finished the conversation off with, ""If you didn't listen to me back then, why should me or dad feel safe to open up to you now?"".... And promptly got called a snowflake. 

I didn't have the heart to tell her I've been having those thoughts again for the last 2 months and already know exactly how, when, and where, and know I would not be found for a long time. She'd only tell me I'm just feeling stressed and upset anyway. Clearly.",mentalhealth,2021-01-20 20:08:03

I’ve lived a pretty good life, my parents are still happily married and have been nice to me most of the time. When I was younger I got lots of things and my parents loved me. 

Except around when I turned 12, when I started puberty, my mother started to be judgmental of my friends because one of my friends cursed a lot or my mom thought my friend was ‘growing up too fast.’ 

My mother would look through my phone and criticize me for things I had on it, she thought I was being too sexual. She caught me sexting my boyfriend one night and took my phone and called me a slut. She would make sly comments about how ‘I expose myself to all the guys I talk to’ constantly around other people trying to shame me. 

She constantly asked me if I’d had sex yet, even though I never answered her. She got mad at me when she found out I’d had sex, despite putting me on birth control because she knew I’d never tell her when I did. She also threatened my boyfriend after she found out and forced me to stop talking to him after a while. 

I used to self harm and when she found out she told a lot of people in our family. She also put me down about self harming whenever it came up.

""I posted this on October 29, 2017. It would not let me share the whole post altogether with that picture of the sunset, so I need to share the rest of it... I need to get it off my chest. I want to be listened to. I want others to realize that they are not alone and that there is help.

To check in with everybody: thanks again so much. I cannot thank-you enough. I will not harm myself anytime soon. It was more carelessness of what might happen to myself, or because of all the stress and trauma, that I would simply die feeling loneliness. I know that I have supports, but again, when all you do is bust your ass at work, maybe help listen to a dear friend or two, and go home, cry, and sleep.... .of course I felt alone.

They say that when somebody loses their significant other, that sometimes the widow/widower passes away from loneliness.

Native children who were taken from their parents, grandparents, and families were thrown into residential school. Many MANY children died for many reasons... One huge reason was loneliness - being away from family and loved ones.

I feared that I would die of this loneliness... and I know that I have such a loving husband and family... but I still felt lonely and unheard... Even though I am still constantly trying to speak up to counselors, life coaches, psychiatrists, doctors, and so on... Every so often I remember which friends I can turn to, but I forget in those dark moments...

I will head to the island once I am not sick anymore, so hopefully later on today, maybe tomorrow... I will be home. I did not mean to scare anybody. Thanks again so much for listening and sharing your love. I need it... I need you right now.... Thank you....

""\*Trigger warning\*

Not a day goes by without dreading and being reminded of this day. Keeping quiet keeps us sick. I am still finding my voice. I am still finding my true escapes. I still struggle to remember who I am... who I was. I was diagnosed before Vietnam even happened, let alone corrupt Vietnamese police, ""family,"" ""friends,"" hotel workers (\*PLURAL\*), strangers, disgusting dusty garages the corrupt and ignorant yet naive Vietnamese doctors and nurses called a ""morgue"" and ""a place where they did forensics and autopsies."" The list goes on. To have a near break-in when you are home and your husband wasn't supposed to be there that night... It can be traumatic to be in one car accident let alone five. It is not normal for a child to stay awake cleaning and rearranging their room getting one hour of sleep starting at the age of 8.

Supposedly I'm high-functioning, but what good is it when all I feel is emptiness, guarded, broke, and hurt? When will I simply have a normal day? I hate what I cannot control... Why can't I truly ever be happy? I can't remember if I ever truly was. I can never simply live in the moment. It's all I want.

It's not normal or okay to grow up around one pedophile let alone several. It's not okay or normal to pretend nothing happened, never get an apolpgy, and pretend everything is okay.

I love the people in my life. I forgive and give way too many chances and get burned so often. I pretend to be tough on the outside because I am so fragile on the inside. I help others because I know how it feels to feel alone, helpless, useless, and pathetic... I know that for some of them, it is not their fault, and that somebody else did something to hurt them, too; so I bite my tongue over and over and observe...

If a child says something is wrong, please listen to them, and find them help. If a native person is in that ""downward spiral again,"" listen to them, point them in the right direction, and be there for them. If a Vietnamese person is having a hard time, maybe there are cultural differences to learn about; there are so many resources out there. If a female seems ""out of it,"" there is so much more going on below the surface. If you see a human being having a hard time, fucking be a decent human being and help one another!

Being a half Native half Vietnamese female in Canada has been a treat, let alone being just one of these minorities or ""less fortunate"" with residential school, war, rape, abuse, and the downward spiral/ripple effect goes on.

Nobody is born an asshole. They are influenced, taught, or pushed into being one.

I just want to feel heard. I am tired of feeling alone. If you can't handle it and don't care, have fun without me. Get the fuck out of my life already!

It is ridiculous that in a so-called free country/world, why is there still so much hate spreading and still so much shame around things that do not matter? Such shallow, selfish, manipulative, and insincere people? Why does it twist my guts to share about the truth? When you keep quiet, nothing changes.

I usually try to keep my writing positive and go over it over and over again, but I am tired of pretending to be okay. It should be okay to admit that you are having a shit day. It should be okay to wear whatever you want or have fun with your friends and family without being put down, harassed, abused, or raped. It should not be normal for men to beat their wives and children in third world countries, or for peers to abuse and bully each other...

Fun facts: Vietnam doesn't have rape test kits. Men are above women. They do not know what mental health is. They lack empathy. They do not have counsellors. If you are raped, you are an embarrassment to the family and dumb for getting in that situation in the first place no matter what age you are or who did it - if your relatives/lovers/strangers did it to you, or even if hotel workers lock you up in your own bedroom leaving you with bruises... Abortions are so common (several abortions for each woman in their lifetime) because it is not okay to have sex before marriage, it's normal for men to have mistresses there, and rape, of course. The cops asked me for a bribe. I did not, so they did not give a shit. If I did, it would come up in court. I can go on forever.

I spend so much time and money on counselling, psychiatrists, doctor appointments, and so on. When will I be normal? When will I be better? I was diagnosed about 9 years ago. How many previous years were undiagnosed and could have been prevented?

If somebody cries for help, fucking help them. Stop shaming them.

Substance abuse is emptiness and loneliness which can lead to suicides, overdoses, and other unpredictable behaviours/circumstances.

Stop the hate and negativity.

If I sound like I am ""stereotyping"" and you get butthurt and nitpicky about how this is written and turn this into shit that it isn't, then you are the problem! Victims fear stepping outside while violators fear going to jail. How the fuck is that normal and okay?!

I have had shit sleep since I was a child. Can you fuck off and stop saying ""can't you just go to sleep?!""

I have gained weight from trying medication to medication, and YES, from ALL the stress, so don't tell me how to fucking eat and exercise and as if it's so easy. It's easy, but it's not that fucking simple. If you truly know me, you would know how active and healthy I was.

I don't need solutions.

I need to be listened to, comforted, and hugged. I can go on and on and on.

I am here for you. I care and it is so much easier for me to focus on helping you instead of me.

I need to stop writing and comfort somebody else now. Could you please do the same?

When I said I needed to help somebody, I literally meant it. I have done it all my life, but that particular moment, I needed to help my crying mother-in-law because Brad's father was very sick in the hospital. I put aside my differences with them because in the long-run, that's what they needed. As weak as I felt and angry I have been with them for feeling like they weren't there for me when I needed them most, I fucking stepped up and helped take care of them.

I am still angry for how a lot of the rest of Brad's extended family was not there for their chief. They were there for the last 3 family members who were diagnosed with something similar the previous few years and have died from it... Why was our chief shamed for telling his mother he was sick? Why were people told to come visit and barely did?

So many questions. So much to say... I know there are stories behind this, and someday, I will listen with love, but we all needed you. I need you now...

I need everybody to know this. I am trying to forgive or move on. Carrying this anger is constantly in the back of my mind. To be silenced for whatever reason is killing us.

Residential school took our language, culture, and rights away from us... They brought us religion... Christianity... and people are still falling into being brainwashed... I know that there are good Christians, religions, and so on out there... but more importantly, this was not our culture before colonization. People are still feeling the ripple effects of residential school... The pain... anger... confusion... People still only see the negative stereotypes in native people... So many still don't know, don't care about our on Canadian history. It should be taught school-wide, and not chosen as an option to learn about First Nations history. That is Canadian history!!!

In Germany, they learn about the holocaust, and Germans respect and realize and feel ashamed about the past. There are plaques of Jewish families who were killed all over the country, to remind Germany and pay their respects. They want to prevent this from happening again. Why can't Canada or North America do the same?

I need you to know that there is help out there...

I need you to know that I try to choose forgiveness... and it feels selfish... I feel like this is being selfish, for doing something for me.

Isn't that fucked up?!

This is cultivation that is still trying to get rid of us... keep us quiet... but it will not work on me... at least not yet...

I have had internalized racism on both sides of my family, but deep down, I know that they have suffered and this is why I try to forgive, or at least, for parts of it...

I want to have children someday... I never wanted any in the first place, because I worried that I would fuck them up... but I know that Brad and I can make changes... be the change we want to see in the world...

People have straight up been openly racist sexist and so on right to my face about Asians and natives... I would tell them that I am half Asian and half Native, or that Brad is half native... They always say, ""oh, but not you guys, you guys are different."" This should not be normal!!! To my native and Asian friends, to people of all walks of life, you don't have to fall into those negative stereotypes. You can do this. The world needs you in it. You can be the change you want to see in the world... You can ask for help. I am here... and there are so many others out there.

Please reach out.

Please listen.

Be good to one another.

Stop the hate.

Educate yourself.

Choose love. Sometimes that means loving yourself and letting go of toxic people...

I can go on forever...

Thank-you...""",mentalhealth,2021-01-20 20:23:27

I'm almost 20, I'm only in my first year of university (for mathematics) I did okay last semester...I mean I failed a class and I've never done that (why tf do I need BIOLOGY for a math degree anyways :/). Other than that I did okay, but I really want to switch out and I have no idea what the hell to do. I have no passion for anything, I have bad social anxiety and despite trying to get better I feel like I'm socially inept...and it's affecting my career choices too. I want to have a job with as little social interaction as possible, I don't really care about making a crazy about of money but my family is oblivious to my mental state (I tried to go to my mom multiple times throughout highschool for help and she brushed me off, even told me I was too 'smart' and functional to have mental problems). I also left my job in the fall to 'focus on school' but tbh it was mostly because of my mental state and being socially anxious/awkward around my coworkers all the time! My sister is soooo much worse than I am mentally, I mean as in it's obvious SHE has issues so it's like whenever I bring my problems up people assume it's really nothing. I want to get help but I have no idea where to even start. I can't afford a therapist. I know I have social anxiety and probably depression but honestly I think I might have some other issues or it might be something else (like I've had periods where I'm literally delusional, I had like a week where I thought I didn't 'need' sleep and that it was a waste of time??? Another time I got really anxious because I thought I had suppressed childhood memories, and I ALWAYS realize how ridiculous these ideas are after I get over it). A lot of my friends describe me as strange/weird and I have never really understood why. I want a full psychological evaluation or something but I don't think I can afford that either. My social anxiety makes it hard for me to even think about talking to a doctor about this, I don't want to go to my family doctor I've known my whole life...ik that sounds stupid...I usually use this online/phone call medical service that's covered for free in ontario so I guess I can talk to someone there? They specifically have a section for mental health on their website. But I feel like they'll give me a referral to a psychologist, which I can't afford, or meds (which i don't know if I really want). I also can't focus on anything...I've always had trouble focusing but online school makes it so much worse.

if a friend was crying, i'd probably understand why they're upset, but i don't think i'd feel sad too. and if i did, it'd be quite weak. or i'd pretend to feel something because i can't stand being so numb.

i'm also pretty desensitized to own feelings. i rarely cry when i *really* want to sometimes. my day to day mood is just a constant 'meh'. like a steady line which is only changing slightly every now and then. 

i've only really noticed i was different in this past year or so but i look back and it started to get bad when i was about 14/15 (i'm 21 now). i'm not sure if something happened to me around then or if i just wasn't raised right, but something feels wrong.

For instance, If the person I'm seeing sends me something that makes me overthink that there's more to it than there is, I immediately start acting petty or being rude. I don't want to do this because they have reassured me so much that I have nothing to worry about and I do trust them, but I don't know why I tend to assume the worst. Every time I do this, I immediately regret it because I know that there are better ways of communication but my parents have neglected everything I say, saying ""you're wrong, you don't know anything,"" so I dismiss what I want to say to them because I feel like they'll think I'm dumb or will not understand me. Or sometimes, I'll end up communicating what upset me after lashing out, but they're like ""you could've just told me this instead of saying all that.""

I try my best to do the following everyday to practice mindfulness:

* Meditate before bed every day for 5 minutes (I know it's not much, but I'm hoping to start little and make my way up)
* Journal my moods/thoughts
* Manifestations
* Trying to analyze my triggers; why I'm feeling the way I am

I used to check up on people and find reasons to think that they were going to leave me, but I've stopped that because I know that my brain just wants to be right when I know this person respects me enough to tell me what's up and leave if they had to.

I really don't want to mess up this good thing I have with this person. I really want to trust myself -- that I'm worthy of love and good in my life.

If I was stressed, down, bored, lonely, couldn't sleep etc I would get on and play something but now I can't do that and it's really taking its toll on me.

I have insomnia to the max and during the day its alright I sit and talk to mum but nothing much, I always need to keep busy with me or I'll overthink and get annoyed with myself. I go on walks but they only have a short effect. So I find myself right now at 2am bored as hell, wondering when I can fall asleep.

We don't even have cable TV and my phone data is about to run out and it's only been 8 days since it renewed so I wont have any YouTube or anything soon im dreading that. 

Worse things are that I can't really afford to replace the parts and it took me forever to save up. I'm on PIP allowance (UK) but most goes to helping mum with utilities and rent. (Long story really stupid) so I probably won't have a new one for like 8 months. I am unable to work also due to problems so I can't get a job, then again who can in these times.

The thing that stresses me the most is that my slobby, obnoxious, lazy, arrogant brother who shouts all day and throws shit around his room and his smashes his desk gets to play on his PC whilst mine broke after an unfortunate event. It makes me feel so bad and he stays up all night too banging the floor and screaming and I haven't no choice but to listen to it.

Personally, it's been a little over 20 years for me, so I'll take it as a win that I'm still here.

Lately, I've been struggling to get back into my old self that was eager to learn and motivated. I'm a fairly studious person and tend to focus my sights on something to keep my mind busy; lately it's been learning another language to help my career. It's strange that I don't have any motivation to learn anymore because that's always been something that's kept my hopes up.

One thing I've noticed is that I start to feel better when someone is talking to me about their struggles and ask for advice. I try to give them the best advice I can and help them see their situations from a different point of view, which has always been a strength of mine. I love helping others and that's one thing that's kept me from doing anything stupid. I know there are people out there that enjoy talking to me and they've been forward in telling me that I've helped them, so I don't want to let them down. I don't know if it's because it gives me the chance to forget about my own life or what, but it's what helps.

Does anyone else feel this way? I just wanna know if I'm being a coward by avoiding my own issues or if it's a normal thing that helping others seems to help.",mentalhealth,2021-01-20 21:18:29

* TRIGGER WARNING \*

&amp;#x200B;

""My name is \*. My maiden name is \*. I was born and raised in \*. I am half Native half Vietnamese North American. My parents had me when they were 20 and 24. I am the oldest of 4. The age gap is 4, 13, and 17. My grandma is from \* (Native Place). My dad is from \*, Vietnam. My grandma is a Residential School survivor. She was 11-16 years old when she went, and came out as an orphan. My dad is a Vietnam War refugee. He was 13 when he arrived with his 3 brothers, but 2 were old enough to live on their own, and the other didn’t get along with anyone, so my dad and uncle were raised by conservative Christian families, separated. My grandma and dad shared with me about their experiences since I was a child.

Some traumatic things that have happened over the years:

\- Starting around 1993. I was left home alone for hours to look out for my infant sister and have had sleep issues since.

\- Around 1996. My grandma’s late partner touched my sister who was about 4 when she told me. So I was about 8. When I tried telling adults, they told me, “he would never.”

\- Around 1996. I saw my mom with a shotgun in her mouth.

\- Around 1997. My dad went to jail for doing something sexual to my aunty (on my mom’s side) when she was a minor. My dad used to do gamble, do crack and sell drugs. It was one of the only times I ever saw my grandma cry as my aunty had to move away.

\- On top of inter-generational trauma as it is, these incidents made me want nothing to do with the cultures on either side of my family.

\- I was in 5 car accidents:

1. \*, spring 1996. My dad had a side-impact collision with a car. The woman was pregnant.
2. Outside \*, Christmas 2006. My ex and I slid on black ice where we did two spins and ended up on the other side of the road, facing the way we came from in the ditch. The car was totaled underneath supposedly I was given a speeding ticket.
3. \*, Winter 2012. I had a work laptop on the passenger seat. It looked like it was going to fall. I pushed it back up the seat, when I looked up, I almost drove into a huge rock. Steering away, the wet road made me slip and spin at least two times. I was confused why it took so long for the breaks to work and switched pedals. Turns out I slammed it back onto the gas. A huge boulder in the ground prevented me from slamming into a tree, literally an inch away. Since it wasn’t raining by the time police arrived, police gave me a speeding ticket. When I arrived back at work after taking a couple of days off, nobody knew or cared, including the supervisor who knew what happened. She bullied many people into quitting their jobs, including myself, and the lady who took over my position within the same school year. I was an Indigenous Family Support Worker and Indigneous English as a Second Dialect Support Worker.

\- 2007, I woke up to my then boyfriend’s (now ex-husband’s) sexually assaulting me.

\- 2012, my ex and I sheltered his brother so he could work, send money to his wife and kids, one who has down syndrome, and eventually move his family to town. I found out through his wife that he sent pictures and videos of me to his friends.

\- 2013, I was drugged and gangraped by hotel workers in Vietnam. I dealt with the corrupt system and received zero justice. I lost loved ones when I needed them most.

\- 2014. A man drove onto the wrong side of the road (across the yellow line into my lane). We had a head-on collision. We was trying to turn left into an alley to take a shortcut and skip red light and traffic. As soon as we collided, he moved his car right away, so I couldn’t get pictures. We both “lost” the case.

\- 2015. My ex and I worked at two places together. A girl was gangraped outside of one of our workplaces. I was triggered by it. I dropped off lunch to my ex the next day at the other workplace. The boss at our other workplace asked what was wrong. All I said was, “I got off the plane…” He interrupted, that I can’t show up to work dressed like that (I wasn’t glamoured because I was just stopping by) and that people want to see skinny girls with “big fake tits” here. He said mental health isn’t real. People who use medications are addicts. He later brought up how we had this suicide awareness fundraiser “to make ourselves look good”

\- 2016, 3 family members, a best friend and her husband died.

\- 2016. My ex rear-ended a car that suddenly stopped because the car in front of it suddenly stopped.

\- 2016. A manager at work asked if I would “suck his cock” several times that shift. I gave him the cold shoulder. The next day, I was fired.

\- 2018, put aside my issues and helped take care of my ex-husband’s dad while he had cancer. When he got better, his parents went back to treating us like we weren’t good enough.

\- 2018, I went on leave for mental health. When I got back, I was fired. My ex urinated in her coffee mug (they never found out). He was fired two weeks later.

\- 2018, my ex and I weren’t doing financially well. We moved back to my triggered parents’ place for free. My ex still sent me to my room to masturbate while he told me how he would masturbate on my dad’s shed walls.

\- 2020, he threw a coffee mug hard enough to leave a dent in the wall. I sat next to it for months before he finally patched it up """,mentalhealth,2021-01-20 21:40:27

* TRIGGER WARNING\*

&amp;#x200B;

""My name is \*. I was born and raised in \*. I am half native, half Vietnamese Canadian. I am the eldest of 4 (4, 13, and 17 year age gap). My grandma is a Residential School Survivor. My dad is a Vietnam War refugee. They shared their life stories with me since I was a child. I lived with a pedophile from each side of my family for 18 years. I grew up practically raising my siblings, feeling like it was my duty to protect them. The incidences and inter-generational trauma broke my family and I wanted nothing to do with either cultures.

I started volunteering at as an elderly caregiver and an ESL Peer Tutor in high school, originally for school credits.

My passion to seek reconciliation accelerated when I was in post-secondary where I wanted to become a family and marriage counsellor. After earning my certificates in \* (2010) and Indigenous Family Support (2011), I have worked as an Indigenous Support Worker/Indigenous English as a Second Dialect Support Worker, an Assistant Manager/tutor, a Community Support Worker/caregiver, and a nanny.

Since then, I experienced even more hardships. Some are car accidents to sexual assaults in the work place and within my ex-huband’s family; bully bosses; 3 family deaths and one of my best friends and her husband passing away in 2016; and being drugged and gangraped in Vietnam, dealing with corrupt cops, medical workers, and government workers with no justice. I was diagnosed with complex-PTSD, depression, anxiety, psychosis, sleep dysfunction, sexual dysfunction, personality disorder, and so on. I left my abusive marriage June 2020. We would have been together for 14 years August 2020.

Over the years, I have explored countless avenues to heal and grow. I worked with many general practitioners, counsellors, couples counsellors, psychiatrists, victim service workers, sexual assault centers, etc. I have tried Dialectical Behavioural Therapy groups, drum healing, sweat lodges, acupuncture, Traditional Chinese Medicine, acupressure, etc. For fun, I have tried kickboxing, yoga, and biking, and have looked into family roots, healing ceremonies, and less known cultural rituals.

Returning to post-secondary will strengthen my passion, cultural knowledge, and independence so I can better serve those in the community. It is rewarding knowing I have made a positive impact on others’ lives. The more I learn about my cultures, the more I love, understand, and grow. I am passionate about building upon the success and fulfillment I have already experienced in and out of the workplace. Connecting with those who experienced similar first-hand has helped, so I want others to realize they are not alone, and there is hope. My passion to help give a voice to those who feel like they cannot speak for themselves. I want to catch things early, before it manifests into hopelessness, the way I felt growing up.",mentalhealth,2021-01-20 21:41:35

I'm currently in an actual residential treatment center, and have been since last year. I've been getting worse as more trauma gets brought up, and things are kind of going to shit right now, especially with (newly-discovered/recently-diagnosed) DID/DDNOS. So, they're sending me to the hospital for assessment so we know a) what's wrong with me and b) what to do about it.

But, here's the thing: I cut myself. Big shocker! I use it as a coping tool for when I'm overwhelmed and need help dissociating. I've been doing a lot better about not cutting lately, but especially with everything going to shit right now I have been a little bit more than usual.  
I'm going to try *not* to cut myself while I'm in the hospital, but if I need to, I want to be able to do so safely. Being safe about cutting myself sounds counterintuitive, but I'm a big believer in harm reduction, and I've been in hospitals before, where I used rusty nails, staples, pencils, and plastic to scratch and cut myself, and got lots of infections and complications as a result of that. So, if I need to cut while I'm there, I want to have a clean, sharp blade with which to do so in as safe a way as possible.

They said they'd do a strip search when I first get there, and will definitely go through my stuff. I use double-edged razor blades for cutting, 43mm x 22mm and very thin. How can I sneak a blade in without getting caught?

**TL;DR** I'm going to a psych ward for 8 days and I want to sneak in a razor blade as a practice of harm reduction. How do I do that?

We can all make it a little better if we try to give a little support to someone every day. To listen to each other without any judgement, to be understanding and empathic.

I think my symptoms are pretty similar to anorexia. A few months ago I started trying to recover. I think about food a lot, I restrict (but now not as much), I used do exercise obsessively, I was a little under weight and lost my period. However, after trying to recover, I'm almost weight restored and I don't restrict as often (I eat about 2300 calories a day, but I still exercise daily and still don't listen to my hunger), but I still think about food and weight and body image a lot.

I've been thinking about getting help, but my eating disorder isn't as bad as it was a few months ago. Also, I'm no longer under weight. I feel like if I try to get help, I won't be diagnosed as an anorexic since my weight is ""healthy"" and my behavior isn't as bad as it used to be. The problem is my parents don't want to get help because of this (they think it isn't that serious), and I feel like if I try to get help but I'm not diagnosed, my parents will get mad at me for overreacting and exaggerating my problems (which they already think I'm doing).

Also, I've heard some people have bad experiences getting help, like how sometimes the ""professionals"" don't even understand how eating disorders work. 

&amp;#x200B;

Basically, I'm wondering if it's worth it to get help or if I should just recover on my own since I'm already doing so and my eating disorder isn't as bad as before. My parents think that my eating disorder doesn't exist and isn't a big deal, so I get treatment and I'm not diagnosed, my parents likely won't ever listen to me or believe me again if I talk about my mental health. 

Also I was wondering if I'm not underweight could I still be diagnosed with anorexia?

I live in Sydney, which you might have heard had a bit of a COVID flare-up recently, not huge, especially compared to most other places but enough to put a bunch of restrictions back into place. So I work as a bartender and as you can guess 90% of the restrictions are on bars and pubs or whatever which naturally means very low foot traffic, which is a good thing, I don’t actually want people going out to drink in the middle of a pandemic, but it also means that my shifts have been cut to almost nothing. Worse still, when I am at work I end up getting sent on break a lot more to save the company money, some nights for as long as 2 hours of unpaid breaks. Other nights it seems like they’re ignoring all the restrictions and allowing huge numbers in the door to make up for lost profit (last Friday it was shoulder to shoulder in the main room of the venue from 5pm until about 11:30pm) but despite allowing those numbers they’re only rostering a skeleton crew of staff, including axing security staff entirely. 

Before the restrictions I worked all the public holidays around Christmas and New Years expecting to get paid double time cause that’s the law here in NSW, only to find out I’d apparently signed some enterprise agreement when I started, forgoing any extra loading for public holidays (I also don’t get extra pay on Saturday and Sunday, again kinda an industry standard here, but I already knew about and agreed to that when I started).

We’ve also been accused of “stealing” by management in Facebook group chats because people were free pouring certain alcohols (heard this is pretty normal most places in the world, but NSW has the strictest alcohol laws in the world to my knowledge). Because of this “theft” we were all forced to undergo an exam they wrote up to prove we knew the measurements of all the cocktails on the menu, the punishment for failure being immediate termination. 

To top it all off this week I’ve gotten a bunch of messages from coworkers telling me they’ve been let go outta the blue, and now I’m just waiting to hear the same thing, never being sure whether I’m walking out for the last time after each shift.

I guess it’s just really stressing me out, I’d quit but as it is I’m not getting paid enough to cover basic living costs, having to drain my savings just to buy food.

for example, the other night i used a food delivery app to have someone bring his favorite ice cream to his door when he was feeling really down. he seemed to really appreciate that! i’m thinking about maybe sending a care package to him with a bunch of mini-mental health kits in them, and he could open one when he needs it. they’d have some of the things i know he loves in them to try to remind him why life is still worth living (pictures of his dog, pictures of us, dumb poems/art i make for him, a little kit with all the ingredients to bake something, random star wars things, etc). 

what do you guys think? any other ideas or ideas building on mine would be much appreciated! i just want to be able to help him the way that he helps me, and make sure he knows that he is so, so very loved. he definitely has suicidal tendencies so i feel like it’s really important that i figure out some way to help.

here’s a brief list of some things he likes just in case anyone feels like being creative!
- his dog that’s back home and he can’t visit right now 
- star wars 
- legos 
- baking 
- the gym
- koalas
- star wars 
- music!! he loves all genres but i know next to nothing about music and i’m not sure what i could do with this 
- peanut butter 
- travel (really wants to go to alaska and japan!!)
- a bunch of random youtubers like the nelk boys 
- did i mention star wars 
- hammocking 
- any kind of cute date like watching sunsets/stargazing/etc
- writing (he’s writing an epic book series right now)",mentalhealth,2021-01-20 22:36:59

Apologies in advance for any spelling/grammatical/formatting errors.

Anywhoozy, I've got an issue that I've been dealing with for a few years now. It's hard to describe, but to put it simply I've been avoiding asking for help for a long time now. For some context, I'm a high school student dealing with a good amount of stress due to school. I'm falling behind, which makes me feel even worse to the point where I've just kind of given up. But no matter how much I beat myself up about it, trying to push myself to just put in some effort, I never seem to have any motivation for anything at all. I'm the kind of person that hates asking for help, so when I get scolded over my grades and told to ask my teachers for help, I'll say sure but then I just won't. Only once this year have I asked for a teacher's help in bringing my grades up, and the whole time I felt like I was wasting his time.

I don't know why, but whenever people help me I feel like I'm just a bother. And then, when I inevitably fail, I feel like the scum of the Earth for messing up. I haven't shared any of these feelings with anyone in my life, as I feel like if I told anyone how much I'm struggling that it would just be a waste of time. Not that they wouldn't try to help or anything, but more that they'd waste time worrying about me when I don't even think there's a way to fix whatever's hurting me. I haven't even really shared any of these feelings online either, I'm surprised I even managed to post this without deleting it all. Again, not that I think that it wouldn't be helpful, but I've just kept myself from reaching out simply because I feel like there's no point. I feel like no matter what I do, I'm just going to weigh everyone down if they try to help me.

I've tried talking to my friends about how stressed I've been and how I feel about myself, but I always end up just saying, ""Nevermind."" Or, ""I don't want to talk about it."" To get out of talking about it. And then they get upset because I'm not being honest with them. Everyone in my life says that they worry about me, that they're willing to talk to me, but if anything that makes me feel worse. I'm making them worry about me by not being at a hundred percent, which is part of the reason I rarely talk about my emotions. I have a feeling that I should get someone to talk to, but at the same time I don't want to talk to anyone about what's bothering me. I just feel so hopeless.

Sorry if all this sounded overdramatic or dull, I'm not used to making these kinds of posts. What I'm really trying to ask is, has anyone else felt like getting help just weighs other people down? And if so, is there anything I can do to get some help? Because I really do want help, especially some mental help, I want to stop hating myself, but I just don't know how to bring myself to reach out for it.",mentalhealth,2021-01-20 22:57:19

I am having a lot of trouble feeling joy and happiness since the loss of a pet who was very dear to me in April of last year. He was a dog who I had for 13 years and was very much a part of me. Life just doesn’t feel right anymore. There have been a few other things that haven’t gone well either. My wife lost her job in March of last year (I dislike my current job but can’t quit now because my household depends on it,) my stepmother tried to murder my father (luckily she failed and he is fine) my step-brother is in prison and is dying from COVID, and I can’t see any of my direct family. I moved away from home in 2019 and left my life behind to try to start something new. Now I feel like I ruined everything I had going for me. I had a band that was gaining success and was having a ton of fun playing shows and I left that for some reason. A long with my childhood friends and favorite places. 

I think my dog was what made me feel like I was a good person and that life was good. Like it was all for reason, and to enjoy the present. I have great friends and a wonderful wife that I am very grateful for, but I just don’t feel good about myself. I do not feel worthy of their love. I just feel empty and gray right now. New experiences and things I usually like to do just don’t bring any feeling. I don’t know what to do because I try to stay positive and try to get back out there to do the things I used to love. But nothing ever feels right. Like I’m lying to myself about what makes me feel good. For example I used to like to go fishing or for hikes. I normally love the outdoors. Now I do those things and I feel numb. It’s like I’ve forgotten how to feel good about myself and enjoy the present. Now it’s starting to affect my relationships with those people who are so good to me. I don’t want to loose them too. At this point everything seems so overwhelming. Everything from chores to work to having fun. It just seems like what’s the point? It’s just work, more work and the good stuff doesn’t feel good anymore.",mentalhealth,2021-01-20 23:02:10

I'm in no way trying to self diagnose I'm literally just looking for answers so if some people could help me that'd be amazing. I've also never gotten testing and theres like a bunch of stuff wrong with so yeah 🤠👍

Okay soo to start this off I'm just y'know going to list some of my ""symptoms""

- Forgetfulness 

- Overthinking

- I don't know what to call it but I need a schedule to feel comfortable with what I'm doing- and then I forget it 😔

- Indecisiveness 

- I get more energetic as the days go on (so like after school/ night) I kind of hold it in I guess you could call it, since I'm like really shy so I cant just start jumping around in class. I think I annoy my sister because I like ram into her and jump all of her and stuff.

- It takes me a while for me to process what people talk about (I also just forgot what I was going to write here✨) (I just remembered- so If like the teacher is talking and I'm trying to do my work I can't focus on what's happening.. basically I can't double task. I'm also a very visual learner if that helps at all 

- I get very irritated way to easily. My mom keeps calling it hormones, but it feels more than that. Kind of think of it as a glass getting filled up with water. Certain things will happen and I cant feel myself getting irritated, but these things just keep on happening until the glass over fills and I break down. And then the process starts over again 🤡 how much ""water"" that gets added and when it's added varies.

- Going off of the last ""symptom"" I mentioned; I had an experience on Tuesday (1/19/20) where I got off my schedule in the morning getting ready for work and everything kept getting out of my way, and everything was too loud. I was trying to ignore it but it got kind of hard when my mom kept yelling ""What's  wrong?"" And I kept saying ""I need quiet, I need to relax,"" but I guess she didn't believe me and thought it was deeper than that I guess 💀 I'll just call that like overstimulating or system overload.

- I tend to like fixate on something really deeply I guess. Like, if it's something I like it'll keep me busy. Right now it's Harry Potter and I go ALL out with what I fixate on. Someone will be talking about something different and I'll just bring up a spoiler or a scene or a character I like or relate to. It kind of feels like I'm from/I should be from that universe I guess. Some of my past fixations were: Marvel (X-men), Hamilton, Homestuck (I know, gross), and there was this horse game I played in like 4th grade called like ""Hill Cliff Horse"" or something of that sort. I had a character named Pepper and she had a backstory and everything. I resonated ✨deeply✨ with Pepper the horse. There's a lot others but of course I cant remember them when I need it most.

I honestly don't know what to do anymore. I feel like there's something wrong, but I also feel like I'm being over dramatic. I usually think like that when I overthink things, though. I'm kind of leaning more towards ADHD (I don't really know other mental illnesses of that sort- if that is a mental illness) I tried talking to my mom about it but she brushes it off, I guess because I get good grades I guess? 

(OH! I also have trauma if that helps with anything. I've also probably got anxiety and depression, but of course I'm undiagnosed because I seem fine on the outside 😁👍)

I mean complete mental break downs since the age of 5. never in public, but they happened with my parents. i used to hit my mom when i was younger. It was terrible. a part of me believes that’s part of being a child who needs discipline. (And trust me, i got it, lots of time- outs.To the point of crying so hard my throat would ache.) and a part of me believes it’s who I am. I don’t know if this plays a part, but, I have childhood trauma stemming from my father who EMOTIONALLY and VERBALLY abused me. I have a younger brother but he was the “favourite” child so he didn’t get screamed at or stuff thrown or scared the shit out of. ANYWAYS, I’ve been having these rages since I can remember. I don’t know why. Something doesn’t go the way I planned or something frustrates me and I CAN’T deal with it. I feel a burning sensation in my upper diaphragm/stomach/chest, and no matter how hard I try to suppress my emotion I literally have no control over what I do or say. It’s VERY. VERY. Impulsive. I have ruined relationships this way. impulsively saying things that I don’t mean, but simultaneously want to say because I LOOK for fights. especially when I’m in the state of explosive frustration. When I get frustrated I cry. I cry and it hurts me so much worse than when I cry because I’m sad.

Ive been at the end of the rope many times but this has been the most calm I’ve been. I feel at peace knowing that I could take my life and I wouldn’t have to live in my mind anymore. I just don’t know what to do with the guilt I feel regarding the ones who love me. I just want to thank everyone who has ever put a smile on my face and leave this planet thinking that they’d be okay knowing they made my time here on earth a little better. I know that I’m going to destroy at least 4 lives by my suicide, but I cannot bare feeling so alone in my head anymore. 
I constantly don’t feel good enough and find myself too depressed to try to make myself better. In the (small amount) times that I do get that spike of happiness and optimism for the future, it just brings me back down and depresses me more when I lose that feeling I crave so badly. My relationships are hard, I know that they will all eventually end and I WILL be alone and I can’t deal with that. School is draining, my memories are draining, etc and I genuinely just don’t see the point anymore. I find myself making ideas of how to leave people some sort of memory of me before I leave. 
I don’t WANT to kill myself but I don’t want to be here anymore. I’m scared of the pain and what the feeling of death will be like. I’m really really scared but I just don’t know what to do anymore. 

I do not want to take pills and for it to not work or to put myself into a coma or some shit 

I don’t want to jump in front of the train (which is a good option) but may scar the conductor/people on the train

I don’t want to slice my wrists because I don’t want someone to find my bloody body, although this would be my first option 

I don’t want to hang myself because that’s how my sister died and it seems too complicated 

I don’t want to hurt anyone in the process but that’s inevitable and that fact is driving me crazy. I don’t want to ruin anyone’s live. 

I just DON’T KNOW HOW TO HELP MYSELF. I don’t want to die but I don’t want to live with myself anymore. And I feel fucking terrible for the people in my life that have tried to make me feel better. I know I’m just a burden on most people.

I’ve struggled with depression before. In my teens and 20s, I would go through bouts of depression where I would cry for hours in my bed and barely eat. These bouts were triggered by feelings of loneliness and self pity.

I’m 30 now and these bouts have become less frequent. Maybe because of the relationship I’ve been in for two years. But I realized recently that I am pretty depressed right now. It’s just manifested itself in such a different way than what I’m used to that I didn’t even recognize it for a while. 

No doubt, the pandemic has got me down. But it’s more than that. 

In October/November, my boyfriend went through a really rough time with his own mental health. He was drinking a lot and sleeping all day and shutting me out. It took a toll on me. I cried a lot and considered breaking up with him for my own mental health.

Then I found out about my moms cancer diagnosis. She had kept it a secret from me because she couldn’t see me anyway and didn’t want to upset me. I cried on the day she told me—even though she was almost done her treatment by then and said the prognosis was good. But I didn’t cry as much as I would have expected for this kind of news.

I guess my boyfriend realized that he had to get better for me during this time with everything going on. He finally started exercising and working on controlling his emotions. I’ve been SO appreciative of his effort to be there for me and I’m so happy to have the old him back.

What’s weird at this point is that I have no emotions anymore. I’m not happy, I’m not sad, I’m not mad. I’m so incredibly numb. I haven’t cried since I found out about my moms cancer in November and that’s weird for me. I have a pretty healthy lifestyle these days. I’ve started running to get outside more and Ive been sleeping pretty well. But I’m a total zombie. Last night I tried to cry, and nothing.

I worry that I’m affecting my boyfriend in a similar way that he was affecting me a few months ago. He definitely recognizes that I’m not myself and keeps trying to get me to laugh but I just can’t. It takes so much effort to even crack a smile.

I know a lot of this is because of the pandemic. The stress of not knowing whats going to happen next and not being able to see my friends/family in person. I also wonder if I just hit a breaking point with my bf/moms diagnosis and part of my brain just shut off.

I hate feeling like this. I worry that I’m bottling up my emotions and that one day they’ll all come out and once. 

This is depression right? Is it a certain type? Should I just ride the numbness until I feel something again? Or will it just get worse?

Thank you &lt;3

TL;DR Haven’t cried in months even when I try. Feel numb. Had a very rough time with my boyfriend in October/November and then found out my mom had cancer. Been an emotionless zombie ever since.",mentalhealth,2021-01-20 23:54:46

My depression doesn't affect my day to day like as badly as my panic disorder does. Today I was doing a tattoo with my mentor watching over me and I finished one completely and was 2/3rds the way of finishing the second one when I began to have a panic attack. 

I cannot control when they happen nor is there any triggers to make them happen. They are completely out of nowhere and I cant function properly until I take a xanax and go to sleep. What first starts to happen is sweating, a metal taste in my mouth, and nausea followed by vomiting, tingling and heart palpitations, then crying or hyperventilating, and finally all of this lasts throughout the whole ordeal with added pain and fire in my brain. This lasts for hours or until I take a Xanax  and go to sleep. I also take Zoloft daily.
 
The tattoo thing happened just about an hour ago and I quit my old job (retail) cause I couldn't function properly at work due to having regular panic attacks. Like I said they are completely unprovoked and scary and awful. I had to leave and my mentor called me later and asked if I was okay but also what am I going to do if this happens in front of a client? Which is a totally valid question. Excatly like today I couldn't finish the tattoo and immediately had to take a xanax and go home.

What can I do about this for my career? Is there any way I can work around that if It happens again? (and i don't mean work cause I can't work when they happen or when I'm on Xanax) As clients or tattoo artists what should I do?

Context: My uncle recently got hospitalized for COVID-19 for a couple weeks and it has been hard on both families. Just 1.5 hours ago, my mom got a call from her sister (the aunt, married to the uncle) that our uncle's condition got worse and was sent to the ICU. Next thing I knew I heard her bawling in the bathroom loudly, and my dad, my brother, and I came to see what happened. We all comforted her while she was crying, sharing our sadness and she asked us to call our aunt, my dad asked her to wash her face after.

As me and my brother call our aunt and check up on our cousins, my parents are talking softly in their bedroom (and it was all in Vietnamese + I'm not fluent), so I didn't know what they were talking about. 

My mom seemed to calm down after what it seemed like 30-45 minutes of talking, then my dad calls us over in the hallway, explaining to us that she's feeling depressed and was worried about us but ""doesn't seem normal"", saying that she apparently doesn't remember anything that just happened. I was confused and went to see her in the bedroom. 

I saw her lying down on her bed watching TV and she asks ""how are you? how was your day?"" as if nothing just happened. She sounded like she just came back home from work and her face looked normal, with no signs of having just cried. I tell her about my day and how I was starting classes, before asking her how she was doing. She just says ""yeah I'm okay! are you okay?"" after noticing I looked concerned. I told her about how we called our aunt and cousins and explained that one of our cousins said she was sad about her dad (the uncle) but was relatively okay. 

My mom responds, ""sad? why is she sad?"" I reply saying that she's sad about what happened to her dad. She then asks ""her dad? why? what happened to her dad?"" 

My dad tells us this is what he was talking about and I told him that she was most likely in very high emotional distress and that possibly her body was responding to this by suppressing it.

Still, I'm shocked to see how quickly she was lost that memory. This is my first time I've ever seen this and we don't have a history of dementia or anything. Even as a psych. student, I'm dumbfounded. I don't know if I should worry about this or not. My dad is planning to stay at home to care for her tomorrow. Should I be concerned about this?

I work in a grocery/retail chain that treats me like a bitch. I am consistently talked to in a negative tone. It is never checking in on me, it is always “move this thing,” “run this out,” just pushing me to the breaking point. I often call myself the pack mule in passing to some of my co-workers because of all the heavy lifting/pallet pulling. It gets to the point where every day I am so exhausted. Couple that with some kind of rude managers. I have one manager who the more and more I work with him, the more I realize he isn’t a nice guy. He always kind of jokes with me in a rude/condescending way and the more it goes on, the more I am noticing it is affecting me. Plus, I am a very quiet kind of person, naturally reserved from years of emotional abuse from schooling. In truth, I think my time is coming to an end with the company, primarily because I am generally very depressed at work and I feel awful about myself. Not to mention, I do think some of my colleagues are worried about me and how much they put me through especially because some of my colleagues see how the aforementioned manager treats me, and think it is a green light to treat me kind of like shit/yell at me.

Anyhow, the happy part came today when I got my lunch. I work a later in the day shift, and often I don’t eat until 3 PM or so. I often grab a small brunch or small snack before my shift. Anyway, today was an especially rough day (started off my shift trying to watch the US inauguration, but a butthurt guy was ranting over the program about how another candidate should’ve been the nominee and other employees of the store were getting fed up with it so I turned off the TV and told him to grow up). I then punched in and every employee at some point today yelled at me about running certain things out, not sure if I knew how to do a job I’ve been doing since near the damn start of COVID, and just a bunch of crap.

So at about 3, I went to get my lunch and in line I see this dear colleague who I have expressed a lot of my frustrations with, and we kind of exchanged a “how are you” conversation. Then I am going up to pay, and she tells me just to get a cup for my soda and my utensils because she bought my lunch for me.

Naturally I told her she didn’t need to do it, its an Irish Catholic thing, we are very much the “you don’t need to do that, we’ll buy for ourselves” kind of people.  Anyway, I then sat down and she told me that she did it because I put up with a lot of crap, and she wanted to show her appreciation for me. I didn’t cry, but damn, it touched me deeply. I feel like when I do leave this company, and I expect it to be sooner rather than later (hopefully line up my exit before or slightly after my one year anniversary), I will need to buy her (and all the good people) something as a thank-you for really helping me survive this job because I have really been thrown through the mental ringer with this job.",mentalhealth,2021-01-21 00:26:51

I really need help or advice with this, I don’t know what to do. I have convinced myself that I’ll never be good enough at anything or know enough about anything. I’m certain I don’t have a personality or any interests. I have so much school work to do, but I procrastinate on it and then can’t do it when the time comes because I keep crying about how much I hate myself. Every day is terrible, I have constant anxiety attacks where I do nothing but lay on the floor for hours. 

I have very few interests and hobbies, and all of them are mainstream and basic. I’m not a “super fan” of anything and because of this I feel stupid and fake. Not even music makes me happy anymore, because all I care about are my listening stats (I track my music using lastfm) and how diverse i am and how much I know about certain artists. Instead of doing work, I force myself to listen to new albums/interviews/live shows/documentaries constantly, even though I don’t want to, because I feel like I have to know everything. I don’t even pay attention to any of it so I don’t know who I’m trying to impress. 

I want to take a break from social media but I always come back to it. I see people online who seem to know everything and are super interesting, I take a break from social media for a bit, and then I feel like I have to learn more things, not because I want to, but because I want to be perfect. And how do you learn about things? The internet. It’s a viscous cycle and I am spending almost all of my day online instead of doing work because of this. 

Even when I’m not online, I’m doing activities for school. But no matter what I do I always feel the need to do more work, join more clubs, etc. I will never be good enough for myself. I hate myself for being so boring and I have no friends because of this. And the people I do talk to don’t give a shit about how I’m feeling, let alone answer at all. I need help or advice or something because whenever I try to focus on myself and be happy for once it doesn’t work out.

Sometimes i feel like I'm wasting my days by doing nothing.  I tried to find fun activities but the motivation would only last for a few hours. I lost confidence and motivation. I'm afraid of the future as well. I feel like wanting to turn back time and return to the happy moments of my life.

Please help me. What should I do?

I hate it when BPD gets conflated with narcissism or other personality disorders. Or when the term “borderline” is thrown around. Gone Girl isn’t a documentary, y’all! Lol. BPD is actually an emotion dysregulation disorder. Meaning that we experience emotions more strongly than others and for longer. Aka, imagine all your emotions being amplified x3 times 24/7 and having to learn how to cope with them. 

We also struggle with depression, anxiety, and a lot of self-doubt and invalidation (most of us grew up in homes where our feelings never mattered, so we never learned ways to cope with emotions in a healthy way because expressing them wasn’t allowed).

But, unlike many other personality disorders BPD is treatable and even “curable” (many people no longer meet the criteria after years of therapy). We also have insight and many of us WANT to be “better” (in fact we’ve obsessed with it, which is ironically the root of the problem - that we believe that we’re bad Lol). I’ve been in therapy through my early 20s and it has helped me tremendously. Getting better has been about learning to love myself and healing from trauma. And most people in my “public life” have no idea that I have a “personality disorder” and would be really shocked and confused to find out.",mentalhealth,2021-01-21 01:20:44

even on my computer my attention span barely last longer than 10 minutes. for example just tonight I started by watching Netflix and even though it was interesting I got bored and decided I want to play a game of chess but after 1 game I got bored and decided the next thing I wanted to endeavour in is YouTube then from inspiration on YouTube I decided that I was going to get the best rank on a game I sometimes play but I only played 1 game before I got bored so I finished the other half of the episode I previously left before.

&amp;#x200B;

after watching this episode which contained martial arts I thought how hard can that be and decided to search if you can be a martial arts professional without leaving your bedroom and stood on my bed doing roundhouse kicks but then I got bored and thought id play another game of chess which I lost again so I went onto YouTube to watch some chess openings and even though I like chess I only got about 2 minutes in. after that I sat at my front window  and decided that since I have just moved to a new house ill try to take notice of little things in their gardens etc so I can figure out what type of people they are.

&amp;#x200B;

 I browsed reddit quickly to see if anything was interesting but it wasn't so I thought okay well its 5 am lets see how many different porn genres there are and I found one called educational porn and I'm all up for learning but after 5 minutes I got bored again and thought id go make a hot chocolate and here I am. there's other things and I rotate between the same things sometimes but its still annoying I cant commit to or concentrate on one thing for more than 10 minutes.

Didn’t know what particular subreddit to post this query to, but this one seemed along the right lines. 

So I was wondering about something. 

I am nearly-completely incapable of reading any long-form text, such as a book, research paper, etc. 

They specific “symptom”, if you will, is that I will go and start trying to read a paragraph. I read a sentence, but I didn’t actually READ any of it. Like, my eyes laid upon every word, and the words DID enter my brain, but when I’m at the end of the sentence, I realize that I didn’t actually RECEIVE any of the information at all. The result of that is me re-reading sentences or paragraphs MANY MANY times before I could even tell you what the thing that I JUST read actually said. 

It’s kind of hard to describe, but I’ve heard of this phenomena before (a long time ago); specifically, people having to re-read paragraphs of text 5 to 10 times before ACTUALLY being able to retain and reiterate what that piece of text says, even RIGHT after you’ve read it. 

Also, I think a big component of this is that thoughts are swirling around inside my head, and I’m thinking CLEARLY about COMPLETELY unrelated things, but I’m doing what WHILE my eyes are scanning left-to-right along the lines of text. It’s like there’s two “streams” going on- one stream is the words on the page entering my visual cortex, and the other stream is the words of the thoughts that I’m ACTUALLY thinking about. And it’s obvious which one wins lol. 

——————

And, if it helps solve this mini-mystery:

I’m NOT depressed (to my knowledge at least lol), I do NOT have ADHD (I was tested, and they said I wasn’t. I *cannot*, however, speak to if that test was *genuinely* correct, tho), i MAY be a psychopath (impaired ability to experience empathy or remorse; egotistical mannerisms; although no anti-social behavior (I’m highly HIGHLY extroverted)), although I haven’t been tested for that; I do not have any chronic medical conditions (to my knowledge); no OCD, GAD, bipolar, schitzo, or autism; I do have a not-so-great relationship with substances, so I stay away from them, with the exception of caffeine and nicotine. 

Please feel free to ask me if you need any additional information or have any other questions in your attempt to help me identify this peculiarity.

It is almost 4 am right now. I haven't slept yet neither have been sleeping very well for the past few weeks. On theory my life is pretty good: have a nice wife, starting a new job overseas next month, have a scientific paper on the way, and so on.

The problem is I suffer from panic attacks, and they have becom frequent. had my first one two years ago. I ended up on the ER thinking I was having a heart attack. I did therapy for half an year and took medication for about the same time. I was also diagnosed with ADHD which frankly was a relief and currently I take medication for that.

The approach of the moving to another country is taking its toll. I have paperwork to fill and visa interviews in the next week. I also started to slowly work remotely with my new group, we meet every week on Zoom and I always get extremely nervous both before and after these meetings, fearing I said something stupid all the time and reliving every meeting over and over once they are finished. I feel really dumb when talking to my colleagues, basically as if I am a fraud and they would do better to have hired someone smarter. I get really scared of disapointing them everytime we talk.

I suffer from anxiety and had about 3 or 4 panic attacks in less than a week, I am not sleeping right, having to take alprax everyother day. I don't mind taking meds for ADHD but I really don't like the idea on relying on tranquilizers to not freak out. My wife is great and supports me like no one ever did and even then I've been an asshole to her today without any real reason.

Fortunately I have an appointment with my psychiatrist next week but I doubt I will be able to start some new long term medication so close to my trip. 2020 was actually a pretty good year for me but I have to agree that the lack of outdoor exercise sucks.

Now I am not sure of what to do in the next few days. Part of me tells me to take take a few days off work since as I am not officially enroled in my new job I am basically just volunteering by now. On the other hand I hate the idea that people might think of me as lazy. 

I also constantly get restless and I have no fun in doing stuff. Or rather I can't focus on them for more than a few minutes at the time, either a video game or movie or book. ADHD meds help with this but there are days it seems to go out of control. I just feel restless and exhausted.

If someone has any insight on this I would really appreciate it.

I am new here so I really hope I'm following the rules and doing everything right, if not please let me know.

My mother has a habit of barging into my room without knocking. I've told her to respect my privacy multiple times but she gets very mad at me and tells me that nothing goes on in her home without her knowing, and this always makes me feel so gross.

About a year and a half ago I attempted suicide and ended up in the hospital. While I was in the hospital my mother went through my phone and found out a lot of my secrets, including that I ordered a vibrator off Amazon and some stuff about BDSM. I know that I'm a minor and I shouldn't be thinking about bondage and all that, but the way I see it I'm not hurting anyone and it's not like I'm talking to grown men about it on the internet so I really don't see a problem with it. But anyways she brought this up briefly when all of this happened but we never really talked about it after that. But she ALWAYS hints at it to make me feel embarrassed/ashamed.

Back to the ""nothing goes on in her home without her knowing"" thing, I feel like she says this to break me down and make me feel ashamed because she knows I still constantly think about how embarrassing it was to have my PARENTS know about my sexual fantasies. I feel so gross and violated when she does this, and I feel like I just want to die or hide.

I have a very nice figure (not trying to toot my own horn) and I never like looking at myself in the mirror naked because I look at myself and obviously I see a woman but I feel like my mother would scream at me because I'm not allowed to be a woman and I'm not allowed to have a body like a woman and I'm disgusting for even glimpsing at myself naked. I have been thinking about wearing a corset for a little while, and my mom said, ""You probably want it for that weird S&amp;M shit people do."" This made me feel so bad that I went into my bathroom and tried to hang myself with a belt but it just wasn't working so I stopped.

Imagine someone is making you undress in front of them, that gross feeling where you feel violated. That's how I feel when I'm around my mother, especially when she barges into my room and gets mad at me for standing up for myself about having privacy.

I am not diagnosed with anything, but when I went to a mental hospital after my suicide attempt I was told I have manic depressive disorder but they never touched on this or anything so I'm not sure if that's the case, but I think manic depressive disorder is the same as bipolar and if that's true then I am pretty sure I do have it because I have all the signs, but I'm not going to assume and self diagnose. I also feel like I might have OCD. There are little traits I have that are signs of it and my older sister was told by her doctor that she might have OCD so maybe I have it too, but again, not trying to self diagnose. Maybe these things are reasons why I feel so violated all the time?

Any help is appreciated. Thanks.",mentalhealth,2021-01-21 02:30:04

im sorry if this is a bad place to post this and i understand if so, but i was frantically looking around reddit trying to figure out where to post this bc it is time sensitive.
i have a 13 year old niece, we live close, down the street. her older sister is also my best friend and we are legal age. she has been struggling with depression and mild self harm/self destructive behavior in the past half year or so. her and my best friend come from a household with a severe alcoholic mother and verbally, emotionally, and possibly abusive in other ways that i have not witnesses or heard about, father. they have 6 kids, many times in their lives had have very little to go around. cps has intervened before but nothing came of it. but im afriad that she will act on her thoughts. situation is very complicated because my nieces immediate family and i have very bad relationship with other memebers of household because one of the brothers has had it out for me for something that happened when we were in highschool. can be very manipulative like the father. i cannot go over there and she cannot come here despite living  close for these reasons. i told my friend/her sister but we do not know what to do, partially because my best friend is planning to finally escape and get to a safe house soon. she is not emotionally able to deal with this right now and has too much technical stuff to work out for her to be focusing on fixing this unfortunately. im trying to act in place of her as much as i can and help niece get help. 
problems are, cant go there if she says shes going to attempt, she is not supervised a lot of the time and could slip thru the cracks, has things to od on at her disposal, and i cant really help her go to therapy because her family wont allow or pay, and i cannot afford. also, if i even just get her on a 72 hr hold in the ER if she says she’s going to do anything, which u would think in theory would be the start to her getting help , this will just cause abusive parent to lash out on her and they will actually be less inclined to let their daughter get help unless legally required. and i cant call cps, for the sake of those kids. been there done that and outcome is the same.i know they would not get taken, would get get mandated family therapy that does nothing for them. i don’t know what to do except talk her off the ledge and then if push comes to shove and she is literally attempting, call 911. it feels like a dead end no matter still. 
please, does anyone have any ideas for me that im not thinking of that may work given these circumstances we are under? very scared but dont have enough reason to call on her atm. kind of a waiting game.",mentalhealth,2021-01-21 02:30:49

TW: SH, suicide, pills, slight trauma mention"," so for context, i'm a 13 year old girl who can't really get a diagnosis for mental health due to financial issues and stuff like that, but i'm looking into symptoms for ADHD (which is something i've been told i have all my life, but don't have a diagnosis for) BPD, and depression.  around may of last year i cut off all of my relationships because of how worthless i felt at the time (it's kind of complicated, but that's sort of the gist of it), which spiraled into some of the worst months of my life. i attempted suicide about 4 times within 7 months. during that time i used cosplaying as a coping mechanism, since i'm into anime and stuff like that.  when school started, i never put work into anything because i believed 100% that i wouldn't live to a point where anything i learned mattered. i'm also a band student, and we had to sign up for district honor band (this is sort of significant later) and the only reason i signed myself up was so i wouldn't disappoint anyone at the time, but i didn't practice anything because i expected to die before the auditions even happened (in January 2021). come to around to right before winter break, i was asked what i wanted for christmas by my mom. i said i didn't want anything. i didn't want wigs, cosplays, figures, or anything like that. really all i wanted was to have my friends back. they were the only reason i was supposed to be here (i'm not big on family for many reasons, which is why losing all of my friends affected me so much). on christmas eve, after gathering the courage for weeks, i contacted my online friends and my closest irl friend, to which i had long talks with the two of them explaining my actions and my mental state. i'm so fortunate they didn't react harshly or anything like that. so great, i got my christmas wish sort of, didn't i? not only that, but i got new cosplays for christmas as well, so everything was fine, wasn't it?

**something that's also worth mentioning is that my mom always buys me things. she screams and yells at me one moment and the next she's swiping her card (figuratively, of course). i think the word for this is 'lovebombing' (???) but i'm not quite sure. point is, she will treat me horribly one moment and then buy me things the next. whether that means i'm just acting spoiled or not, idk??** the next day, i woke up at around 12PM, as any teen on winter break would, and when i went downstairs, my mom didn't give me a pleasant look. she asked me when i was going to practice for honor band, but i obviously couldn't tell her what's been happening (for all she knows, i'm just an anime-loving girl who ""spends too much time in her room"") so i just told her i'm being lazy and that i didn't wanna do it. she then went on to scream at me about how much of a disappointment i was, and how i was disappointing everyone, as if i didn't know that already. later on, i decided to get into cosplay to try to deal with the feeling of shame and guilt i got from that event. while i was in the middle of doing that, i was called and got yelled at again for something (it was so trivial, i forgot what it was) being my fault. but this wasn't really like the other times i got yelled at, it was way more intense and angry than usual. she kept telling me about how everything is my fault, and how i'm always going to be disappointing. (another side note, the reason why everything is 'my fault' is because i take blame for my siblings when accidents happen because i don't want them to get hurt) in a fit, i ran upstairs and tore up the makeup and wig that i spent hours on, and hid in the bathroom and self h\*med. after i cleaned up, (it was around 8 or 9pm by now) i layed in bed to try to go to sleep early so i wouldn't have to deal with anything else, however my mom pulled me out and made me spend 'family time' after i clearly was tired and wanted to rest.

my mom apologized and offered to buy me something (which i said no to), and then after about an hour i was finally able to go upstairs. it was about 10PM now and i logged off my phone to go to sleep, but a few minutes later, my mom slammed open the door (not exaggerating here, there's a hole in my door now.) and demanded me to tell her where her phone was. confused and barely waking up, i told her i didn't have it which lead to her, at first, joking around telling me to just give it up. after telling her several times i never even touched it, she yelled more violently than i've ever heard for me to tell her where it was. my dad was screaming as well, waking up my sibling and yelling at them that they couldn't sleep until they found my mom's phone. this was when i told my mom that i 'had' it (i never had it, i just didn't want my siblings to get hurt.) and she started getting more violent. some of it is a blur but i remember she started to resemble my trauma, and i had a panic attack and screamed at her to ""get the fuck away from me."" i screamed at the top of my lungs for her to leave me alone and get away from me. you'd think that if your child was screaming for their life for you to go away, you would, right? no, she just came closer, yapping about ""don't talk to your own mother like that"" and whatever. it's a bit of a blur after that, but i remember being in my room with my head down with my mom trying to hug me, even after being clearly uncomfortable with being touched at the moment. (actually, i did make it clear to her before that i was not comfortable with being hugged or kissed without consent, but i never explained to her that it was because of trauma). she kept saying if i didn't hug her she would take away everything, but i really didn't care. i would rather lose everything than touch her. eventually after an hour of her practically forcing me to hug her, i was in so much pain physically and mentally that i caved in and swallowed 33 pills.

i wrote a note to my friends that i'd just worked so hard to get back telling them that they literally meant everything to me, and i wrote a quick note to my siblings telling them i was sorry for everything. i just wanted to die in peace while i still could. the attempt obviously didn't work, and i spent a few days in bed recovering from being 'sick' (as i told my mom). i'm perfectly ok physically now, but i dont know what to think of this whole situation. i really feel like i'm just being over-dramatic and dramatizing this situation. so dear reader, i leave you with some questions    
am i in the wrong?   
should i have done something better to fix the situation?   
   
does the fact that i don't like physical affection mean that i 'hate' my own mother?  
what can i do to get a diagnosis/help without my parents knowing?  
i'm sorry this was so long, it was mostly a vent, but i really need help as well. also don't worry, these events were from about a month ago. if you have any questions, i'm more than happy to answer (i'm new to reddit though, so excuse me if it takes me a bit to respond)  thank you if you read all the way through, sorry for taking up so much of your time.  TL;DR, my mom yells at me for everything being my fault, and thinks i hate her because i don't like physical affection. after a panic attack when i screamed at her to get away from me, she instead came closer and forced me to hug her. am i in the wrong for not wanting her to touch me? how am i supposed to get help for this??",mentalhealth,2021-01-21 03:37:43

this is my first post on here so I dont really know how to start. Im 19 years old, I study mechanical engineering and currently all of my courses are online. 

Since the pandemic started, I constantly have ups &amp; downs, which is quite normal Id say. 

But since a few weeks/days Im just tired of everything all the time.   
I used to go to the Gym 3-6 times a week, now I havent done anything on 20 days.   
In November I bought a piano and was happy to finally learn it. Now I dont practice at all.  
After a normal day of university (4-5x 1.5h sessions) Im totally exhausted. I cant get anything more into my head.

And that made me wonder: How do others manage this situation so ""smoothly""? Of course, for none its going perfect right now, but some seem to be fine with the sitation, while others are experiencing mental disorders.

I've just found out I've got low levels of vitamin D and I heard that vitamin D can affect serotonin levels. 

I've been diagnosed with persistent depressive disorder a few years back. I stopped seeing a psychologist for 2 years, and last month, I went to see a doctor cause I was getting really bad intrusive  thoughts to a point where I felt like I had no choice but to either speak up and be judged just to see a GP or kill myself (not the best way to put it, im sorry) I didnt want to but it felt like a dead end for me and I couldnt bear it anymore . I got prescribed luvox and its been helping me tbh. Intrusive thoughts are sometimes there but I no longer obsess on it and my moods a lot better now and I can finally say I'm a lot happier, I'm still a bit stressed because of whats happening right now in my life but im in a better place, thats for sure.

 I saw another doctor last week to get a blood test and she told me I'm vitamin D deficit. 
Could it be possible that my depressive symptoms and intrusive thoughts a few month's ago were caused by low vitamin D levels?

My old psychologist i saw 2 years ago linked it to the abuse I went through when I was a kid but im not sure about the more recent symptoms (really disturbing intrusive thoughts).
 I just mentioned an old diagnosis to give more info, not sure if its relevant but i just wanted to let you kind readers know there was already a history before the blood test results came out.

I just cant stop thinking about it and thought this would be a good place to get some answers to feel a bit at ease before I see my GP in a week or so.

So I’m currently 16, and over the last year my mental health has really gone to shit.

For almost 4 years I’ve been constantly stressed and uneasy, but this year broke me. I’ve been feeling depressed for a few months, and over the last few weeks I’ve started experiencing derealization and stress tics I’ve never really been angry, but lately I’ve just felt the need to punch shit and sometimes punch myself. 

In the summer I had suicidal thoughts, but not anymore luckily, and cut myself. I don’t cut anymore, but punching or scratching myself has become a habit when I’m really stressed. 

I’ve been skipping school a lot and my grades have dropped.

I want to tell my parents that I want to go to a mental ward, I just want to get treatment and have peace for a few weeks without having to worry about anything but getting better. I’m really scared to bring this up because I really don’t want them to be angry or dissapointed. How can I bring this up? 

They know about my breakdown in the summer and I’ve been seeing a psychiatrist every two weeks but it doesn’t really help. 

Thanks for listening lol",mentalhealth,2021-01-21 05:38:08

It’s been helpful to an extent and can be a good vent session but it’s a temporary relief. I’ve done CBT, Compassion therapy and one to one. 

My father is still seriously ill, lives half way across the country and I can’t see him regularly. I still live in a household with my mum whom I have a complicated relationship with. Who was my childhood abuser and is a irresponsible person with mental health issues. We are a lot closer now but have a more roommate/ friend relationship but she’s still a very negative person. She’s a hoarder, irresponsible with money, very messy and judgemental. She is however no longer physically and rarely emotionally abusive. She’s also tried to get to know me a little more but it’s the bare minimum tbh. 

I usually just leave her be and enjoy the sanctity of my clean minimalist bedroom. My sister also still has depression and trauma and I worry about her. But like our mother she’s engaging in self sabotaging behaviour. I’ve recently referred her to the GP to set up some mental health help for her and decided it’s no longer my problem. As selfish as it sounds she’s 17 now and she’s old enough to take initiative to better her own life. I love her to bits but it’s exhausting essentially raising her all these years. 

I feel like most of my problems and stress are the result of other people. I am constantly putting out fires that I have less time to focus on myself. I have an amazing partner. I will be studying a qualification I want to do. I am thankful to have a job with co workers I like especially during Covid. I have personal issues such as weight management and anxiety which I’m working on. I’ve recently tried compassion therapy which has been ok . But I couldn’t even get through my first session due to my mum being panicky wanting me to take a phone call from my sisters school for her.  It’s not my responsibility or fault she’s an absent parent with no idea what’s going in her child’s life. 

It sounds awful but I’m tired of everyone in my house being such negative downers. I’m not the problem. I have my own struggles but am able to deal with them in most cases.  My family members focus on drugs, destructive behaviour, getting into debt, self harm and general poor decisions. I refuse to live like that. I know I can achieve more and I will. 

I shouldn’t have to be on anti depressants because other people’s actions. I have taken steps such as art for relaxation, using essential oils, CBD oils, journaling, exercise etc. I spent 6 months last year living in the same town as my dad to be closer to him until I ran out of savings and honestly besides a bit of social anxiety around people I had no issues until moving back in with my mum. She brings out the worst in me and it’s like childhood insecurities arise out of no where. 

I can’t afford living costs and course fees living independently with my current job but am longing for the day I can move out. Until then I’d appreciate it if anyone in a similar situation could give me any advice or share their story if their in a better place now to help motivate me.",mentalhealth,2021-01-21 06:01:19

this is a repost from my other post in r/advice ,i just need this to reach more people because I don't know what to do at all.

**I don't know if this needs to be marked NSFW I don't know if this sub will delete this post idk idk but I apologize for anything taboo in advance.**

I'm writing this because I just don't know what to do at all. I have a very close friend in a situation that only I know the full extent of, but seeking outside help seems to not be an option, and I seriously don't know what to do, this is way beyond my level of support.  Sorry if I am unable to explain the situation clearly, my head is a mess and it's four am. (five now proofreading this lol)

The situation I'm at right now is that my friend 'M' has very traditional parents who don't believe in mental illnesses. They have gone to therapy and been diagnosed with both Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD) and depression. They have had two or more suicide/near-suicide attempts in the recent past(7 months), and likely more previously, and have opened up to me about not wanting to keep trying (trying at everything, wanting to die). They lost interest in most everything they used to enjoy, and any anti-depressant medication has been ineffective and 'Numbing'. On top of all this, they live in a household with an extraordinarily manipulative parent figure that treats them super awfully, with both mental and physical abuse. the parent has diagnosed OCPD, and is untreated. The parent holds unrealistically high standards in everything in life, and is so control-oriented that they watch and criticize everything M does. The abuse can range from anything as small as weird shit around the house like standing next to them while they eat and waiting for them to 'spill something' so they can punish M, or as far as physically hitting M, specifically in the head. This physical abuse was what drove me to try and find someone else's advice to help, because it has gotten so horrible in recent times. For example, I will be on a phone call with M, hear the parent enter the room, they hang up, and call me back an hour later or so and will have no idea where they are or what happened, but only know that their head hurts and that they feel as if they are in danger.  There have been times that the beatings caused a trail of blood down from the scalp across their face. M has shown multiple different signs of a traumatic brain injury, however I don't know if it's due to underlying mental illness/disassociation. These range from anything such as locking up physically and being unresponsive out of nowhere, horrible chills out of nowhere, losing thought process and repeating the same words (very common when stressed/after parent interaction) standing up and thinking they have to go somewhere or that something is happening, or even feeling like their head/brain is 'splitting in half'. Random side note because im tired and cant format this properly w my current mental state but I believe the second parent is just under complete control of the manipulative parent, because they seem to sometimes stand up for M, but not often. they have gone to family therapy in the past, and the therapist had wanted to involve CPS. they stopped seeing said therapist because doing so would look bad on the manipulative parent's something or other for work idek, dont quote me on that.  ALSO a therapist M was seeing had tried to explain how M is feeling to the non-manipulative parent in the past and the parent just rolled their eyes and stated that M was being dramatic.

M has confided in solely me and told me to not share the information to anyone and I have been doing everything in my power to try and keep M safe/mentally stable, but there are too many things working against me and I just can't keep up. M has began therapy again starting today after the parent finally allowed it, but I am still worried for M's safety. I know that a normal situation like this, calling social services/police/whatever would be the best thing possible, and despite our strong friendship, I am willing to sacrifice it by betraying their trust if it means saving them. The problem, however, is that I don't know if doing that would actually help, and I fear that it may be the deciding factor in committing suicide. They have told me before that seeing me is the only thing in their life they enjoy, and that I am the only reason they keep going, that being they don't want to hurt me and tries to believe me when I tell M that we can get through it. By betraying M like this, it might end up being what pushes M over the edge mentally. On top of that, the parent is extraordinarily abusive by threatening to withhold college funds, should M not go to college/live where they want m to. The parent has set up everything to be able to control M their entire life, even requiring a percentage of their income until they get married, knowing M would comply because he can revoke college funds and not give M a place to stay, etc. There's a lot more that is happening but I feel as if I have portrayed the point. 

The question I have now, that you understand some of the situation, is what do I do? I am currently just trying to provide support in any way I can, however I do plan to contact someone if I know for a fact that M is planning to commit suicide. I know that's a stupid plan and doesn't ensure her safety whatsoever, but I'm just afraid of causing her suicide by contacting CPS. Also contacting CPS would likely jail the parent? fire? idk but the parent would likely not be able to see M, something M has strongly strongly disproved of when mentioning the idea of outside help. **M has specifically told me that involving CPS/counselor etc. would make the situation so much worse for them.**

&amp;#x200B;

**TL;DR: Friend is suffering physical and mental abuse in their household, has untreated mental illnesses that amplify suicidal thoughts, and contacting/reaching out to support programs like CPS or counselors etc. would likely make the situation worse/drive them to suicide.**

 M is 18 and in highschool.

severe BPD, and I am M's 'Favorite Person', or FP, something that I don't entirely understand but it involves obsession or whatever idk

Only allowed to see me two times/week

My family would be willing to support M if need be, maybe not entirely financially but they would definitely be willing to help when necessary 

College will be out of state and out of parents physical abuse, however will still be controlled and will be living multiple states away from me with just their sibling.

College would be after graduation in June.

United States

Their family is upper middle class and considered comfortably wealthy, as well as mine.

i'd rather not disclose my state but if need be i can.

If anyone at all can give me any kind of idea of what to do, or any affirmation that I'm doing the right thing, anything. I'm trying so hard. I have my own mental illnesses to deal with and this is taking such a huge toll on me, I don't let M see it at all because M's always scared of being a burden, but it still is. I don't know what to do. Thank you for reading this far, it really means a lot to me.",mentalhealth,2021-01-21 06:06:09

I haven't cried as badly in over a month. It somehow hurt me so bad, I spent the next 2h breaking down, having full on suicidal thoughts.

Intermittent explosive disorder and marijuana withdrawl

Hello! This is my first time writing here. I have a personal issue. My boyfriend who has Intermittent explosive disorder and has been consuming marijuana for the last months on a daily basis, has decided to stop smoking it 3 days ago. We expected him to feel more irritable, anxious and mildly depressed but he’s now feeling absolutely miserable and says that he feels like he has nothing to live for, after having a (not very severe) nervos breakdown yesterday. 
Do you have any idea what will help at this moment? And maybe it was a bad decision to quit smoking so abruptly without having a psychatric backup treatment to help him go through the withdrawl easier? 
I have to mention that he has never taken a medical treatment for his Intermittent explosive disorder. I read that antidepressants combined with anticonvulsivants might help, and also cognitive behavioral therapy. But we don’t know what to do at this right moment.

We both changed drastically due to work and health issues and when I thought I was starting to get a hold of my life, she tells me that I need to let her go.

It absolutely destroyed me. I never cried so hard for so long in my life. I am convinced that I am cursed to be alone and miserable for the rest of my God-forsaken life and it took every ounce of will power I had not to jump in front of a moving train. 

I'm glad that she's happier where she is now and we're still on mostly good terms, but a small part of me wants to hate her and wants her to feel as bad and miserable and lonely as I do so much. Am I wrong for feeling this? 

That day has plagued me every single day since and I think I'm losing what's left of my mind. Make no mistake, suicide is absolutely NOT an option, but I just don't want to keep going anymore.

I want to get over this, but I think my perfectionism won't let me. This happened almost a year ago, but I'm still very bitter and I still get nightmares. I just wish I could reach into my brain and switch it off. The pandemic hasn't done me any favors either.

It feels like no matter what I do to  better myself, I will fail and the universe will always inflict pain remind me of of that.

I   (young adult male) would like to ask your help to make me stop making   negative body comments. I have a relationship for almost a year now  with  the best girl ever. However, what started in the beginning as  ""simple""  jokes about her butt size later turned out to severely impact  my gfs  perception of herself. She talked about this with me and since I  didn't  know it made her feel bad I vowed never to do it again.

Fast forward to now, **I failed**   that promise. It seems that I slip up with an interval of roughly a  few  months. I make a comment about her appearance or weight thinking it   isn't serious, which in my eyes at that moment isn't. However, for her   it is and I really hurt her doing that.

I   genuinely want to stop this. I don't want to body shame my girlfriend   or anybody for that matter. It seems I lack some common sense in this   area. Since I know how much these comments hurt her, but yet I keep   doing it. The problem lies that at the moment, I don't realize what   negative undertone my comment carries. Could you please help me change   this awful behavior?

It could be   that I inherited this behavior from my family since it is common for my   parents to comment (negatively) to each other about their weight. Also   I've been told I am a perfectionist. Do mind I am NOT using these  things  as an excuse, but as potential sources of my behavior.

I am Elly, I am 20 years old, I come from Egypt. But I have lived all of my life in the Gulf. Im about to turn 21 this year and I am not happy about it. Typically when you age you look back to see atleast one good thing you did that makes you grateful for who you are as you aged. Aging is supposed to be a good thing that makes us look back and be happy for the memories we have created and such.

Not in my case. I came to realise that I was a result of a forced marriage which connected in my head from all the abuses and the fights and verbal or emotional and physical abuse I have seen and had and listened to. It was gut wrenching to come to understand that all of that was a reality I was part of. It was a weird childhood considering how the childhood itself was a fever dream, both good and bad.

Growing up in a middle eastern society my Autism became undiagnosed and growing to fuck me up even more and more. It screwed me up so bad that It made me think maybe I dont have autism maybe Im just actually stupid enough which is much much worse knowing that you're a normal person but actually cannot give anything your best knowingly to how bad you are compared to people

I failed alot of my studies in highschool and schools. Even though I always given everything my best I just ended up with the same shocked state of ""how can I fail"" when I everytime tried my best but still got met with the same result. and everyone l looks at me and tells me that ***everything is going to be okay. Just try again and things will be fine just keep trying and you'll go somewhere trust me on that***

No this is not okay. I am not okay with this state. I am 20 years old and I am unemployed and I am not in college I dont know how to drive a car or a motorcycle. I dont have proper career choices that I even initiated. I dont have job experiences I dont have money savings, I dont have a good family that loves me for who I am. I dont have someone who I can love. I dont have what I can look forward to.

You all will keep telling me im still young but i am missing out. I have missed out on alot of things when people out there much younger than me did the things they were supposed to do or they were even less fortunate than I am and somehow managed to do it. I am a mistake I am not supposed to be alive. I shouldnt be struggling this much this is inhumane, the amount of mental scarring in me.

Would have made a convicted criminal depressed. That's how awful I am feeling. I wish I can make anyone understand the struggle I am in. I hate how my brains functions I wish I was smart enough to figure out things on my own and make things work in my favor. I struggle at everything. people usually tell me ***you look too beautiful to have Autism like that, you're just faking it honey ......***

Even now I am considering to go to the US and seek Asylum and go to Community College considering I am LGBT and Ex-Muslim, which my family will disown me if they come to discover. But even then that plan in itself is terrifying because I have no one who would help  me. I dont know how things work there and im struggling to obtain a job where I am god knows how hard it will be there so no.

Let me give you a written example on how I picture my emotions and thoughts:

***""As I am walking down the abandoned building. Joyful laughs can be heard from outside as they're living the moments of their time. Coming outside as I am joining them in their playful times, they run in fear, running with them I only come to notice they're running from me. I am the threat. Saddened by the realization of that thought like bitter news, I walk back to the abandoned building sitting on a rotten chair and listening to the same music looped on repeat, staring outside as everything moves in a fastened motion. I am frozen in time yet my body ages, I move forward yet I am in my place forever and forever being put on that like a displaced object only missing from a place it does not belong to""***

I am too old to ask for help and I am too young to complain about alot of things I shouldnt be worried about. I have suffered alot and all of these things combined go through my head for hundreds of seconds on a daily basis. The only forbidden solution that appeals to me is ending it all. I know this is not a good idea and I know that's a bad thing and I keep on battling that thought everyday but,

The state of becoming nothing would be much less pain and suffering from all of that. I see no good outcome that could change away all of that. My childhood is ruined and I am ruined, I shouldn't be existing to this far long because I am damaged being with zero good outcomes that may emit from my side, I just wish I was a happy child. Had a family that loved me. Grew up with a family that helped me at my studies, or even helped me getting a job. been at my side. Anyways, I'll go now thats all.",mentalhealth,2021-01-21 07:40:09

First post, I hope that I am not breaking any rules.

I have had anger issues all my life. I have been to many psychologists during kindergarten and first and second grade. I get angry easily, and when that happens, that is usually very destructive.

Whenever I get angry, regardless of the circumstance, I smash whatever it is in my hand to the surface that is nearest to me, let it be my desk or my bed. This is not only not ok, during these breakouts I have caused several hundreds of dollars of damage and I have also injured myself numerous times. Yes, my wounds can heal, but for me initially getting those wounds because my pen dried out and I got very mad over it is a little bit fucked up. 

These issues usually get worse when I am under pressure and when I am tired. Right now, I am experiencing both and for the record, I have broken my second Xbox controller today, got my thumb fucked up badly and this was the thing that drove me to these subreddits and made me re-evaluate my problems and finally made me realize I need help.

I tried all kinds of methods to prevent this, but I have zero self control. I tried stopping whatever I was doing and think, but that made me even angrier and caused me even more damage. I tried putting down whatever it is in my hand, but that does not work consistently and 90 percent of the times I still ended up smashing my things. I tried hitting other things like my pillow, but that also made me even more pumped up and angry. 

Is there any way I can in the very least minimize the intensity or the frequency of these breakouts? I have a feeling if I don't stop this, things will get much, much worse.

The internet is my last resort as I am too afraid to approach my parents with this in order to maybe get me professional help, I don't want to get scolded and grounded for things I have barely any control over.",mentalhealth,2021-01-21 07:46:43

I’m 17 and I always find myself needing validation. I also constantly drift off into fantasies where people are admiring me for my art or writing, or attracted to me. This is something I’m trying to overcome in therapy. I know this is caused by my low self esteem. I just want to feel wanted by people.

I also have a past of being extremely judgmental to friends to make myself feel better. I’m trying to work on that as well right now and think that it’s gotten better, but whenever I have a spare minute to think, I look at some of my friends who are falling apart and think about what went wrong in their life. I don’t know if I do this to also make myself feel better. 

I’m just really scared because I want to be capable of love (I haven’t experienced it because I’m still very young) and I want to have stable relationships with my future wife/kids. I also have really bad OCD, so this diagnosis could honestly be part of a panic attack. What do you think?",mentalhealth,2021-01-21 08:06:18

Just to give some background I’m a 17 year old girl from the east coast. My mental health issues came to light October 2018 and even though I was put into therapy I was hospitalized a few months later in January 2019. Life just went off the rails after that and I was hospitalized again last October and I’m really struggling with life and school. Not to give to much away but I used to be a really high functioning student in an honors school and now I’m barely passing special education classes. 

My parents sat me down yesterday and told me that they really wanted me to go to this program and that if I said yes that in about a week I would be shipped out to Utah (yes I understand that traveling during a pandemic is risky and a horrible thing to do, but this isn’t a vacation). After thinking it over last night and doing some research I came to a couple of conclusions. 

1. I will most likely have to repeat a year of school, but the way things are going right now, I probably would have to anyway. 

2. I will be away from everything technology based for months. I am definitely addicted to it, because the first thing that really made me question whether I wanted to go was the fact that I would be phone-less.  

3. I love nature and I genuinely think that Utah is one of the most beautiful places I have ever seen (from pictures at least) 

4. This is the opportunity of a life time, but it’s expensive.I was initially really concerned about the cost but my parents told me that they had enough saved up, and they would just hold off on big purchases for a few years (they wanted a new house). 

5. I will learn to take care of myself and have a lot of time for personal reflection. Also I love to write and I think I will find a lot of inspiration in the desert. 

So yeah today I decided that I will go. I’m somewhat at the ends of my wits here and maybe a big change in life and scenery will change things. But still I’m really worried and nervous. Has anyone been on a program like this  or have any knowledge about it? Any info would be much appreciated",mentalhealth,2021-01-21 08:15:51

like i think to myself okay let’s start by taking my cups and mugs downstairs, except then i realise that the sink is full of dishes, so i think okay i’ll wash those first, except the drying rack is full so i have nowhere to put them, so i’ll put those away first but i can’t because my house is a fucking mess and there isn’t room to put anything, last night i stayed up until 3am trying to organise my cupboards so i’d have space to put away dishes, and that involved removing a bunch of tupperwares that i never use to make space, but then i realised that i have a weevil problem (even tho i keep food in airtight containers??) so now my kitchen floor is just covered with fucking tupperwares that have nowhere to go and my room is still a mess and the dishes still haven’t been done!! 

normal people don’t struggle with extremely simple tasks like this, but i find them to be crippling, i get so overwhelmed and i feel so useless and i end up hating myself so much and just crying.

i forget things too, like all the time,, i’ve missed 2 assignments just because i was focused on trying to keep my fucking life together. i’ve always been like this but when i was younger my parents helped me, like they’d do the dishes most the time so i’d have less things to focus on, i’m 17 now but my mums in hospital and my dad is at work all day so i’m on my own. i always thought this was something i was just going to grow out of,, but it’s only getting worse.

i’m so terrified i’m gonna fail when i get my final grade this summer, and i have absolutely no plans for next year and it’s freaking me out... how the fuck am i suppose to hold down a good enough job to move out if i can’t even do the most mundane tasks!!!

i’m constantly making lists to remember things,,  but then i forget about the lists.
everyone around me seems to be doing fine, i have a friend who literally does everything right, she’s a perfect example student and does every single task to the highest standard, she’s never missed an assignment and i just can’t understand how it’s so so easy for her but i’m just failing at everything. like what’s the point of even trying to have a life if i’m this fucking useless, i just end up making people mad at me.

I became severely fatigued and anxious about going into the school, scared to meet the responsibility of standing and teaching in the class.

After a week I woke up and just broke down in front of my fiance and said that I could not do this anymore. She got worried as we had planned to become teachers and with the job market the way it is, her and I began to worry about our future. I had planned to kill myself after that, to jump in front of train and be done with life. I sought help and now doing a bit better.

He has not been the same person since. Before being diagnosed he had a schizophrenic episode whilst I was on holiday and tried to kill my mum. This ended up with him getting sectioned and diagnosed. 

Anyway since then, he has not been the same person he used to be. He's on so much medication it keeps him mellow. He used to be a confident gym goer who would exercise everyday, had loads of friends and tidy.

Now he literally sits and watches TV all day everyday, he is extremely overweight and never leaves the house. It is a challenge to encourage him to leave the house. He has recently been having heart issued and has really high blood pressure and I'm worried with his lifestyle that he's on his way for having a fatal heart attack. We've tried for many years to help him, he's had therapy, the doctors are always there if he needs them but there is no convincing him to change his ways. He would be quite happy to die IMO.

However I always end up immediately kind of feeling weird, or not up to any therapy when I imagine myself talking about my problems with them.

We will call her Sam. She was always very boy crazy, like to an extreme extent. She would text boys telling them she liked them, even though she had never even talked to them. She would get rejected every time. Two years ago, she met this guy. They lived far away from each other, so they started texting and had a long distance friendship. 

He ditched her for a time when he got another girlfriend. My friend was upset, but she dealt with it. Several months later, this guy reached out to her telling her that he broke up with his girlfriend and he wanted to start talking again. About a week later, they were dating. (Mind you, they had only met in person one time and had not seen each other in person in over a year).

My friends and I all told her we felt like the relationship was sketchy. It was not him, it was her. One of my other friends knew him and she said he was a good guy and she trusted him. It was Sam who we didn’t believe was ready for a relationship. Knowing how boy crazy she always was, we just had a feeling this would go bad. And we tried to tell her this both before and after she got into the relationship.

She became obsessive. She texted him at least every hour of the day. We all went on a trip last summer and instead of hanging out with us, my friend would go alone to the room and talk to her boyfriend on the phone. She did this several times when we would hang out.

About two weeks after they got together, he broke up with her. She didn’t handle it well. She would cry every second she was alone. It’s been 5 months and she’s still getting over it. Now, she’s bitter about anyone who is in a relationship. We’re worried about her and we have been for a couple years.

Here’s the thing. Although the rest of us love her and care about her, hanging out with her has become frustrating. She talks about herself every chance she gets. She always tries to remind us that either she has it better or she has it worse. One of my friends is getting it the worst. She literally can’t handle this girl anymore and her own mental health is suffering. She’s told Sam this, but the emotional dumping never stops.

The final straw was about a week ago when we stopped by at another friends house together. We were all having a really good time and having a lot of fun. Until Sam started complaining that she wanted to go home (we were her ride so she couldn’t just leave). But the rest of us were all having such a good time. We refused to take her home and told her if she wanted to leave, she should have brought her own car.

She does this kind of stuff all the time. It’s like the world revolves around her. What she wants, she has to get. We just can’t keep doing it anymore. Everyone feels bad saying it because we love her and want her in our group, but we all want to start hanging out without her. She refuses to get help from anyone, even though we all feel like she needs to go to therapy for a lot of her past issues. She’s a better one on one kind of person, but nobody wants to hang out with her one on one because she only talks about herself. We have a few other friends who think she hates them because she’s so rude to them. They don’t shy away from letting her know that they don’t like her, and she doesn’t seem to understand why the rest of us are close with them but she feels left out.

The rest of us are just pretty laid back people and shes really high maintenance so sometimes we think it might just be us and the fact that we’re spontaneous and not the best at accommodating to her needs. But even when we’re thinking in our heads that we want to go home, or we’re having a bad time, nobody ever says it straight up like she does. It’s honestly hurtful when we’re hanging out and she says she’s not having a good time and wants to leave, and we don’t understand why she won’t do just that. It’s like she says it to try to get us to accommodate to what she wants, and until we do it, she won’t stop complaining. 

One of my friends is trying to get someone to talk to her parents about considering therapy. We feel like anything we say is not taken seriously and her parents have no idea this is the way she is. We have a lot of family friends, so in theory finding someone to do it shouldn’t be that hard. She really needs help. But is this just normal teenage behavior? Like being self centered and complaining a lot and taking forever to get over a breakup? I feel like a lot of people can be like this, but it’s just weird because the rest of the group loves each other and makes each other feel comfortable and valued. She never hesitates to let us know when she’s not happy or having a good time. And if she’s not having a good time, we don’t understand why she keeps coming to stuff.

We honestly don’t know what to do. If nobody talks to her parents, it’s going to get so bad. For all of us. The rest of us are fine when it’s just us, but behind closed doors I know that my one friend is really suffering because of their friendship. Cutting her out can’t be an option because the circumstances don’t really allow it. We’ve reached out to trusted adults to talk to her and people know she’s an issue, but nobody does anything about it. It’s frustrating to see my friends suffer and know that a lot of people know, but nobody knows exactly what to do. 

Any advice? Should we just let her be like that and just start ignoring it more? We’re scheduled to hang out next week with a bigger group and we all decided that it might be better to just ignore her complaints and let her go off on her own and do her own thing.",mentalhealth,2021-01-21 09:45:39

In the past month and a half, I have had nothing wrong or particularly upsetting happen in my life. Admittedly, I was stressed before then, but nothing abnormal. I'm usually a stressed person, but what's been going on I've never dealt with before and it's getting to the point where it is negatively affecting other relationships in my life.

For instance, these ""episodes"" typically occur when I'm around my boyfriend, regardless of what we are doing. Sometimes they don't, but there seems to be a pattern when I am with him. They last around an hour, and consist of me uncontrollably shaking and crying. It's embarrassing and the fact that he's trying to help makes it worse because, although I know it is irrational, I become convinced that he's annoyed, frustrated, and will leave. I feel awful during and after these episodes, but I can't seem to stop them either. Sometimes they occur in waves, where I start to feel better again, then everything hits again.

It's occurred to me that these might be panic attacks, but I've had those in the past and they were so physically different and unpredictable. These just consist of feeling awful inside, and I know maybe thirty minutes in advance when I start feeling one coming on. I've had a history with anxiety in the past, but nothing ever like this and I just don't know where to start to get better.

He's so sweet, caring, and considerate; I can tell these episodes worry him greatly and its making me scared to be around him as to make him associate me with these. I desperately want to become better so that things return to normal.

For the next few years I slept with earphones however I would obsessively take an earphone out and strain my ears to see if I could hear anything. 

I wanted to watch a movie upstairs on my laptop, as my room downstairs didn’t have wifi. I heard them again and again knocked on the door to ask if they could at least be quieter until I left, a wave of dread washing over me. My mum came out to explain that it was just a healthy parent thing to have sex, I told her I understood that but would appreciate it if she could keep it down until I go back downstairs. My dad got PISSED with me and shouted that I was being bratty and I got upset and left. 

A few more instances occurred of me hearing them and having a panic attack resulting in telling them to please quiet down and then getting incredibly mad with me. 

I understand that sex is normal for adults, I know that it’s healthy for them to do it but I get really upset about it, as if they’re being disrespectful to me, even though I know that’s not true. It usually results in panic attacks and dread with guilt afterwards.

I started taking medications in October 2018 and started with 2 types and the dosage increased dramatically. The doctor also prescribed me with new medications along the way. By February 2019 I was on 7 different types of medication. Obviously I wasnt taking all 7 types 3/4 times a day. Some of it was just for before bed. Anyways it was pretty much those 7 medications with probably 1-2 more along the way. I manage to cutdown on the types of medications by myself.

By may 2020 i was only on the 3 types of meds i take for sleeping.

I'm never usually a perfectionist, but any time I made any mistake, I had to start over what I was playing, and I was playing as fast as I possibly could.

Then, I decided I needed to leave, like I need to escape my room. I had no idea where I was going, but I felt like throwing things and kicking things on my way there. I got to the top of a hill and threw myself down it, twice. I got up again, wandered for a bit more, and finally stopped at a grotto to pray, where I cried a bit and calmed down.

I recalled the sensation, the feeling itself rather than the specific circumstances (of which there were many). 

I recalled how easy it is to catch one word accidentally from a strangers conversation and suck it into part of your mental narrative. 

You immediately, without any actual effort compress that word to fit into your (actually very narrow) ideation and belief whilst simultaneously expanding it into a full sentence, part of a conspiracy, a sign, it can be many things but it is always something significantly much, much more than just the one word. 

You may not have even overheard the word correctly. It may just sound similar to something you're focused on but because your desperately seeking understanding your brain makes that word fit into some part of your psychotic beliefs. 

I can't express enough how instantaneously this happens. It's not a choice and it happens so quickly and flawlessly however much you realise some of your thinking is off and however much people try to talk you through it completely overwhelms any logic or reality you and/or others are trying to apply. 

To observers its something that 'happens'. To the psychotic person it just *IS*. Reality does not happen, its inescapable and these beliefs are very much a reality. They were to me at least.

I'm screaming internally. I feel the world crashing and burning. I get overwhelmed at the easiest task these days that I used to do with so much ease.  I have tried relaxation.

It’s finding things like negative automatic thoughts, thinking traps, rumination, anhedonia, core beliefs, problem solving etc. 

So far I have clips such as from Inside Out and BoJack Horseman (really good portrayal of rumination), but I’m just wondering if there’s anything that’s come to mind that has helped other people either normalise their experience or that they have found helpful in understanding.

The lack or sleep or the hypomania?

I miss it.  I miss feeling productive.  I get the best of both worlds.  I get my alone time until 3, sometimes 4, then wake up at 6 or 7 on the dot.  I have energy to get out of bed - no, too much energy, so much that I actually jog.  Me!  To be honest, I probably feel good because society deemed it healthy.  Doesn't matter, I feel good.  

I opt for podcasts on my way to work. TV no longer interests me. I clean, something I usually can't bring myself up to do. I no longer daydream and escape my problems, instead, I'm ready to take on the world.  Sure it has it's draw-backs - lack of sleep will get you that. Paranoia, lack of attention to details, brain fog, unable to empathize with sad people, etc.  But it's worth it.  Because when this short window of opportunity is gone, I go back.

It starts with a few simple, ""I don't want to"" or ""I don't feel like doing..."".  Then slowly it morphs.  I no longer want to clean, not even my body.  I sleep 8 hours yet I crave, no obsess over sleep. I can't get up.  It's no longer ""not about me"", it's ""everything's about me"".  The whole world is against me.  The whole world hates me, why can't they xyz??  The paranoia and anxiety takes a different turn.  I'm bitter. Sad. Mad.  I avoid people.  All I do is daydream or netflix until my brain turns to puddle.

I've tried to keep the hypomania up.  It works, but the anxiety becomes too much.  I wake up with a pounding heart.  I have to talk to someone, right now.  I have to do something, right now.  I get paranoid - like conspiracy theory paranoid.  It turns into anxiety attacks.  Then panic attacks.  But I feel good, I don't need help, no you don't get me, suddenly you're all against me.

I don't know if I can go onto details much. I never went into therapy before nor did I call anybody for help that much.

I am just clearly understanding that most of the beginning of school year. I'm so brain dead ever since October came, my concentration was affected badly as well.

Online learning is difficult already, I had no understanding anymore about our lessons but then again, people made me feel worse at this point. I couldn't continue at all after one of my teachers with the similar subject as my junior highschool teacher of 8th grade being slightly strict and mocks other students. I'm usually the quiet type at school. I was literally traumatized knowing I got the same treatment for somewhat being such a weakling, but one thing affected me more was when I was so confused and asking what part of the thing I was supposed to do, the only class member just shames me for what happened to me that day, and I never knew her at all really. I can't really help on school projects nor do my homework/projects anymore after so much time trying to cooperate but everything is just a mess on doing those projects/group activities in a group chat. I feel such a disappointed to my teachers, knowing I'm failing badly.

Other than that, I still live with my own mother whom neglects me for who I am, or at least treats me like I shouldn't have been born at all. I tried asking in another reddit before school became more chaotic for me but it didn't go so well... All I know is that everything affected middle to late childhood years from her side. I can remember things to take care of my pets, I can tell my mum wouldn't care anymore if one of my special cats got catnapped. his name was ""floof"" and was a normal street kitten that had experienced trauma from his previous ""home"" (a.k.a our neighbor's boss' office) at 1 and a half months old I believe, before our neighbor got him and was gently put in a small box. He was my therapy cat to be honest, he helped me out at times when I was having a hard time but had a subtle moments of zoomies which my mum didn't liked at all. 8-9 months of looking for him and sending missing posts in specific groups, nobody replied nor saw him at all. Anyways, my mum never really treated me right at all before much except if I wanted anything from the store/shops when we get money. If I try to clean things specifically (I was not taught properly since growing up, I'd act like a kid a lot but it became less and less), my mum would call me slow and would take that role instead even if there were already similar actions on doing so that made no sense. My mum wouldn't care of my mental state, she would call me an ""addict"" for being on the computer or saying my drawings would usually be ""demons"", even though they are not. Sometimes she would embarrass me to the neighbors or my brother, even would also talk about comparing me to other ""successful"" mutuals which I get easily offended and mad for that reason but I was also brokenly crying at the inside. It's so much discouragement my mum gives me. My mum would tell me I should get a job that even describes something that isn't suitable for me, and I don't want to go underemployment nor unemployed due to low trained skills on socializing or cleaning (I already am planning to have a job that makes me feel comfortable with, and it's not the one my mum picks for me). I can still remember that trauma moment when I was almost woke up early in the morning but my mum had to kick and hit me with a clothing hanger in the back then getting yelled at, which forced myself to not go to school after that day, and I was only at high school that time. Even this decade, she doesn't know I was in contact atm with someone, when she called me an addict, she tried to harrass me verbally so much about my own life being a ""failure"". And he was furious knowing how terrible I felt after the aftermath, even heard the whole conversation (he may have not understand it much but he heard so much fuming in the call).

I really don't know what to do. I tried contacting a suicide help number or at least an emergency number from my country but it's either not available nor does it exist for mobile (those contact number info was most likely found from the internet). I want to get therapy but I don't have enough for it yet. If I asked my older brother for help about the situation, he would just tell my mum the situation too and then fuming will start, which gives me more trust issues into this family of mine. I'm just lost now that most of my life is just being wasted by lack of living what's best for me. I'm very unstable emotionally and mentally, and full of frustration now a days. I can't really relax my mind at all.",mentalhealth,2021-01-21 12:00:30

anyways i remember one of the last appointments i had with this psychologist, she was trying to refer me to an ADHD and autism specialist, but my mother thought it was absolute bs and she obviously didn't wanna pay the money for that. i was kinda like whatever about it, didn't really think i had either of those at that point

in the past year 2 people have mentioned that i possibly could be autistic, the first was an actual autistic guy i was having a conversation with about how shite autism speaks is, and obviously sounding rather upset about it, he assumed i must be autistic as well, so when he brought it up i asked why, and other than the previous conversation he said that i ""seemed autistic"".

the other was my boyfriend who mentioned that i display some of the same characteristics as some of the autistic people he knows, but maybe I'm just weird and its all a coincidence 

the fact that i probably wont be able to get a proper diagnosis until i have a proper income upsets me

anyways i flaired this as a question because i wanted to know if any non autistic folk have any of the same symptoms as me because as soon as i mention any its automatically just assumed to be autistim

anyways the first thing ive noticed is that i struggle to understand sarcasm and jokes and take things literally all the time, i also struggle to understand people sometimes 

also idk if this is something autistic people experience but i cant understand what people are saying unless i see their lips moving? i feel like i can visually understand what theyre saying before i process the audio, same thing with subtitles, i just miss more than half of the dialogue unless i visually see it

another thing is when too many people talk to me or i hear too many prominent noises at one time, i get angry and rather distressed

most of the time i am introverted and would rather not talk to anyone at all, but online I'm a little more extroverted but i still have periods of not wanting to talk to anyone, same as irl

i don't feel like i need friends because i have a boyfriend and that fulfils all my social needs most of the time

i get these phases of being obsessed with a certain thing, its happened all my life, and i know in regards to neurodivergent people this is called a hyperfixation. the first one i can remember was monster high dolls. kinda like barbies but there were vampires and zombie girls etc. i was obsessed and it was all i would talk about, my most recent ones were makeup and now skincare. i wouldn't call them hyperfixations because i dont have a diagnosis 

also anyone else get super anxious and avoid calling people by their names? in fear of that you'll pronounce it weird even though its a one or two syllable name? like chris or max or john etc? 

another is writing essays, in school i was never able to make it flow well, no matter how hard i tried.

if youre still reading, ill ask again, does anyone experience these? also tell me whether or not youre autistic if you feel comfortable doing so",mentalhealth,2021-01-21 12:21:32

I can't make friends because you can't talk much through texts. I never got the texting, hanging out and meeting with friends my siblings got. I've been feeling very lonely recently and I feel depressed now after seeing teenagers around my age (17) just hanging out laughing. I see it on Instagram and social media and I am always the outsider too damaged to get any closer. 

I don't know where I was going with this but I just had to get this out.",mentalhealth,2021-01-21 12:45:12

I behave in a way that just isn’t me. I wish I could just stop everything, hit a reset button and try this whole thing all over again.

I'm 33 and I have 3 kids. A few years ago, I was pregnant with my 3rd child. My partner was a stay at home dad and I really thought that he could be doing more around the house and I used to come home pretty pissed off. I still had to do all the laundry and most of the cleaning while he raised our boys who went to pre-k part-time. We had a dog too who didn't take a liking to me, mostly because I was often filled with anxiety and anger and didn't really know how to work through my emotions. Once he got a job I had to change my whole schedule to fit his job (I worked retail/sales) and had to switch from full-time to part-time which wasn't terrible because I was pregnant and exhausted. I was so sick with this pregnancy! Getting to the regret...

I kind of pushed us to move. See we were living in a 2 bedroom apartment but I felt like it wasn't enough room and I didn't like the area (it was fine, I miss it now) and I was just full of hormones and emotions and thoughts from other people that ""I deserved better."" You know, the shit entitled white people tell underprivileged white people who look know how to dress well with Goodwill clothes :-) So we moved into a ""nicer"" community that was way more than we could afford. I pulled them from a Pre-K that they really liked and carted them to my Dad's or Grandma's in between our work shifts. After I had my daughter, we got rid of the dog because he was aggressive towards me and my oldest and I don't blame the dog, I was a shit owner and didn't see it at the time.

Well, during maternity leave, my job location closed and I was laid off. I was like great! I finally get to be home with my kids and I just got my middle son in Pre-K and my oldest was in kindergarten and I was having a great time with my daughter and then we got a kitten! She was so awesome and was my shoulder kitty and cuddled with everyone, but she did like to get out and it was hard keeping her inside.

I ended up working at an old job I had and it was so toxic, my anxiety took a turn for the worst and I would call out for the most insignificant things and ended up quitting with a 3 weeks notice because I couldn't handle it anymore. My partner was disappointed with this move from the beginning so he definitely was ready to move once my unemployment ran out all together. I was struggling to find any other work and we eventually needed to move and my Dad let us stay with him. We stayed with him for about 6 months which meant I needed to switch my kids school, pull my middle son out of pre-k for the 2nd time and my oldest went from part-time to full-time kindergarten. He did really well and he liked his friends, the parents at this school were absurdly rude but whatever it is what it is.

We moved again, now this time we bought a house... WHICH IS WHAT WE WERE SUPPOSED TO BE SAVING FOR AT THE VERY FIRST PLACE BUT I WAS IMPATIENT AND PUSHY.

Fast forward and I got a full-time job, the kids are in daycare and in a school and it's good but I have mental health issues so they crept up. I had a panic attack at work, it's another toxic environment but it's in an open office so you can't really get away from it. I end up getting a second job at night because it would allow me to quit the first, get the kids out of daycare (it was literally eating my paycheck), and stay home if they are sick without getting in trouble at work.

Well, one day I was rushing to the second job, my cat got out.... We couldn't find her, 2 days later, we get a call that she's dead. I am fucking devastated, she was the chillest cat and every time I think about that day I want to kill myself because I know I am the cause. I was rushing, I told him to look for the cat, but he was home with 3 kids... I was just an ass hole. I cry when I think about her or the place we moved from. Now my middle son needs special education classes and I blame myself because I was always so angry and I couldn't relax and just be there when it mattered for my family. I feel like I'm always stuck in my own head. I don't feel like I ever do anything right and it has been eating away at me for the past 4 months...

I just don't know how to get over these impending thoughts of being a failure. I can't be positive and say I'm a smart wonderful woman because my history shows me I'm not. Every day I wake up and just try to be better for my family but my depression and angry just make me either distant or mean. I've tried medication, I've tried therapy. I've tried mushrooms, I smoke weed for anxiety. I just hate myself most of the time especially when I think about us moving the first time, the poor dog we gave away, and my cat. I know my son will catch up but I just feel a lot of blame inside for that too.

I came here, because I saw that other subbreddits considering general health, didnt have a question flair.
Anyways, onto my question. 2020 has been wild for me, because I just switched psychologists. The reason for that, is that I almost commited suicide, and she mishandeled it, so my parents took me to the clinics, where I got my new psychologist. She recently told me, that she sees me as a 15 (almost 16) years old girl, who is free from any kind of mental illness. She also described me as someone, who has autistic personality traits. She suggested talking to a doctor tho, because I havent got my period yet, and it doesnt seem to come(note: we already went to a doctor about this, nothing is wrong according to him with my hormones). I also have overly hair legs, sometimes i feel a slight twitch in my body parts (like my leg) atleast weekly.

Dropped out of school at age 18 (I turn 20 the coming May) shit I was meant to do (usual entrepreneur bs) just didn’t end up happening, now I’m at my lowest and each day it’s a different issue playing in my mind- different issue out of a catalog of about 173 of them.

I don’t even post anything like this or even anything on anywhere, overall pretty reserved, but it’s just 4 walls and me right now. 

Either it’s a day of being the small me or the person I want to become steering my mind and body, I guess my main question is: 

how do I know if the me that feels better is actually right and not just blinded by optimism?

They've decided to take away all of her devices unless it is for doing online school work, and I am not allowed to discuss anything that is not related to school work with her (so no mutual interests like book series and tv shows etc).

Now my sister is a very imaginative girl who can easily get lost in her thoughts of various fictional worlds, choosing to spend her time reading and looking at various fan content of the things she likes. She also has a lot of trouble making and maintaining friendships simply because many people find her annoying. Given we are in a pandemic and she can't go to school to see anyone, her only resort is to interact through social media. However the few friends she has don't seem to be reaching out to her. 

My point is she doesn't have anything else to do outside of school work besides indulging herself into these fictional worlds and her imagination. However, parents believe this is the cause for her struggles with school work (and to a certain degree it is, sometimes she wouldn't put enough time or effort in her work and choose to spend the remaining time reading fanfiction or looking at memes) and have chosen to cut her off from them completely. But from what I know of my sister's personality and behaviour this is not going to help the way my parents think it will. They hope that she'll shift her focus back on school work and abandon her other interests, but all it will do is cause her to become depressed and angry. She'll just end up hating them and when/if she gets her devices back she will be even more obsessive because she'll have been deprived of all her interests. Her school work will suffer because she won't have any real motivation to work hard.

For the past one and a half years I had a long distance relationship with a girl from another country, unfortunately we weren't able to meet at all last year, due to the pandemic. But at least we were texting and talking every wake minute of every day, besides when she was spending time with her male ""best friend"". I was very suspicious from the beginning, because there were a lot of occasions that seemed unusual for a normal friendship, but she was always able to convince me that they just have an unusual friendship and he's just like a brother to her. I guess love really does make blind. She was often joking about my jealousy and teasing me about them doing sexual stuff. And again I believed that she was only joking. Two months ago she finally confessed to me that they are friends with benefits and that since the beginning of last year and now she developed feelings for him. Now I know that all the, often detailed, ""jokes"" were in fact true and I can't get the images out of my head. So besides the usual heartbreak after a breakup, I now have those painful images of them, that haunt me all the time. But the biggest problem is, that every time I see, read or think something slightly sexual, I immediately think about all the sexual practices with him she ""joked"" about and that creates a feeling similar to a panic attack. By now I feel almost phobic to anything sex related. I have dealt with breakups before, but this is the first time in my life that I've been cheated on, and the first time I'm feeling this way and I really don't know what to do.

earlier today I was scrolling through social media (which historically has had negative effects on me, so I've learned to distance myself from it). I saw something on my feed that triggered me and caused me to spiral into old, dangerous thinking patterns before I thought to pause and reground myself. now I can't shake this feeling that I've ruined all of the healing I've done; even going so far as to think that the progress I've made must not be sufficient enough because I was triggered by something that I feel should not cause this reaction in me.

My siblings were better in school than me. i didn't achieve anything in school, while my younger sister went to various competition and my brother had a good rapport. Ever since i was a kid my parents (esp my mother) often used high intonation or comparing me to their friend's children and of course, my siblings. I know their intention was good, but made me struggle back then. I struggled with self-love, self-acceptance and confidence.

Throughout my high school and college years, I was struggling with it. I thought that by talking to her, she would share her pespective and helped me to understand her better. So in my 23rd birthday, I wanted to talk to my mom about this, hoping to understand her better. I tried to explain it slowly without any sarcastic remarks and I apologized to her for my mistakes. However, my mother didn't think what she did was harsh and I just tried to offend her. She never admit that sometimes the way she talked was harsh.

shortly, It became a family gossip, especially when she told my older brother about it and just now he mocked me with it. I love my mother and brother, I really do. But to be honest, I don't know what to do next.",mentalhealth,2021-01-21 14:53:44

 this is very strange, this feeling of wanting time to pass quickly, because usually I always want it to pass as slowly as possible because whenever I have fun it passes very fast and I keep thinking like uow, that feeling of happiness has already become one  memory, ours passed very fast.

I (25f) have a boyfriend (30m) who I absolutely adore. I’ve noticed in the last few months that my mental health has been going ill quite a lot, along with this I’ve also been getting increasingly insecure and jealous. Now he hasn’t changed his behaviour or anything, he’s very loving and supporting. He isn’t aware of this jealousy due to the fact that I don’t want to seem controlling etc and know very much so that this is a problem with me, however I can’t even see him like a girls Instagram picture without this overwhelming sadness boiling over with me, an act that 6 months I didn’t care less about. 

Has anybody been through this and maybe has some tips or practices that helped them overcome this?

I remember having to lie to my parents to make sure they didn’t call the cops. The feeling of dread I had when we had been caught together was unlike anything else.
It’s been almost a whole year since then and I thought I was completely over it but I had recently watched a few episodes of a tv show called “a teacher”. (For those that don’t know, “a teacher” is basically a story of a female teacher grooming her student) I noticed that the tactics the teacher used on the student was similar to how my ex had treated me. Then when I got to a certain point in the show, I felt my body start to react. My heart started racing, I was sweating, and I felt a nauseous feeling in my gut. 
This was the same feeling I had in the moment that me and my ex got caught together.
It felt so intense that I had to stop watching the show and calm myself down, I was almost at the point of panicking. 
I know now that the whole relationship was wrong, I was a minor and they were an adult but the relationship itself wasn’t traumatizing yet I still have this reaction to remembering it.
I’m just confused about the whole thing now.

I've never liked school, I think the system sucks, but since I've always gotten good grades anyway, the whole topic never came up in my family.
When I started the school year, 8th and last grade, I was on the edge of quitting, because the thought of having to deal with the teachers and the stress drove me crazy. The year started out pretty okay anyway, and when we switched to distance learning I was more than happy, since it meant I could avoid meeting certain people and places.
But lately the pressure just completely takes over me. While in school I could at least go home and take a break, school is now all present every single day, even weekends and evenings. If I want to spend some time outside (I have a horse to take care of), it means to spend the whole evening working on tasks just to keep up.
I know my breakdowns, they come and go. Just this last one doesn't seem to go away. For the past two weeks I've cried every evening over all the undone stuff, and barely eat or sleep. This has happened before, but never this long. I try to keep it away from my parents, since I know it's a hard time for everyone, and I actually shouldn't complain about my situation, it could be so much worse. (Parents still got their jobs, own horse)
I'm in my last school year, it is just three more months of school and then my finals. My mom would tell me to keep going since it's not long anymore. But I'm so done with everything. And the worst is I feel so sorry for myself, that I don't even get to work anymore. Teachers keep emailing about missing work and new work and just more work. And I just want to avoid all the negative stuff, which results in even more bullshit do deal with. One week of hard work could probably fix most of it, but simply thinking of it is making me want to hide away. Furthermore I already gave up the idea of going to university (at least right after school) since I wanna give myself time. 

This is so messed up. I'm crying now just as I'm typing about this. I would really appreciate some opinions from strangers on this.

I really try hard to do thing I enjoy and even if it‘s just spontanously waking up early and go see the sunset in some nice place. Or watching a short youtube video or my fav series. But as soon as it ends I am back in my ‚sadness cloud‘.

Is it just me or do other people also feel this way?

I felt this way the last time after my dad died. I was 14 and it was very sudden (he had me at a quite high age). I didn‘t have any energy at all. And I just always got back to the thought that I am never ever going to see or talk to him again. I could cry constantly at school, at night. I had some problems with my sleep as well, but it got better after some weeks.

I also don‘t want to burden my boyfriend with this. I know it makes him sad as well when I am not good. Just as it is the other way around. And I don‘t trust anyone other enough to talk about it. Eventhough my mum and I have a good relationship and she is also in therapy.

I am really just at a point where I don‘t move forward anymore. I try to eat relatively healthy, and do some excersise. But I also just don‘t have enough time for it since I do a self-study school &amp; work next to it to be able to afford to go to uni after I finish school. 

Does/did anyone experience something similar?

New on here and new to seeking advice because I am literally at the point in my life in which my past is going to destroy my current and write off my future. Saddle up and hold on to your butts because this is going to make you think there is no hope for humanity.

Me: 37M, Married for 12 years, with my wife for 14 years. Both working professionals with good jobs, own a house, two cars and next to no debt. Almost the perfect picture. Almost.

Background:

My wife - perfect, cookie cutter background, childhood, education etc. Nothing here to see.

&amp;#x200B;

\*CAVEAT: I am in counseling but I need anonymous open opinions, not ""you need a psych eval."" Thanks. I'm asking for honest and friendly advice. Do not bother responding if you don't have any thing creative to add. 

&amp;#x200B;

Me: 

I have a personality disorder, BPD to be specific. Until I was a teen, they had a functional relationship. Then my grandmother died. A catalyst in setting a toxic path. My mother went off the rails and became alcoholic, like uncontrollably and overnight a different person. This, in the same year my father was diagnosed with a brain disease that eventually killed him two years ago. Her erratic behavior resulted in multiple affairs on her part. Nothing my dad found out until at least a year later.      

He had a failed suicide attempt. Mom kept drinking. Kept sleeping around, denying it, disappearing sporadically. I once had a school friend call me (by now I was 15) - she was dead drunk in a local bar, flirting with just about anyone. I had to drive (no licence, took my dads car while he was on a work trip) and effectively rescue her from the bar. She screamed bloody murder at me and so did her friend who was always a slut and had her own fucked up marriage, encouraging my mother to be a free spirit. Now call it what you will - one must never call their own mother a slut but that is what she was. My father was a warrior, he fought and fought and forgave and forgave and believed every dirty lie she told. When he finally lost his shit, she called him a domestic abuser, called the cops and had him arrested. Then, after being charged with drunk driving, she confessed she made it all up.

Fast forward to 18, I met a woman 16 years my senior. Beautiful, bubbly and real breath of fresh air. But I was vulnerable. And I ended up paying. Through my naivety, we moved in after just 2 months. Primarily so I could escape the house from hell. She spent the next four years emotionally and financially abusing me. I accrued a shitload of personal debt while she was self sufficient and we agreed she would take over my finances. Again, through naivety I allowed her - but she did not allow me to see her finances. I missed all the signs - we argued, we made up. One day fine, next day not. I now understand that was a pure narcissist which scarred me for life. She physically attacked me with a wine bottle. This fight caused a neighbor to call the cops. Guess who got arrested? Not the bloodied teenager on  the floor. The screaming a hysterical woman who was 'defending herself' after an argument because she thought I was going to beat her. We reconciled after about 4 weeks. She had always withheld sex as a 'punishment' for each an every time I got on the wrong side of her. Yes - I should have ended it. Yes I was stupid. I get that now.

I had long suspected she cheated. But had no proof. If I asked her, she would fly into a manic rage and lock herself in the bathroom for several hours, not speak to me for at least two days. One day, we were at a traffic signal. A droptop car pulled up and the guy driving with his friends yells ""I've had her! I've had her, just a few weeks ago!""

Again, through my naivety I refused to believe some random asshole who was clearly drunk was a source of truth.

Fast forward to 21. My constant need to resolve blazing rows resulted in me getting fired from my job for spending too much time on the phone, being late etc etc etc. I leave work, go home and there she is, getting fucked by TWO guys. There was violence, people were hurt and I was stabbed. That was the end of it. I am scarred for life. 

\*DEEP BREATH\*

About three months later, I got my fairytale. Through a dating site I met the woman who is now my wife. A year younger than me. Instant love story, happiness. We did move in pretty fast but purely for logistical purposes as we lived so far apart. It was perfect. I shut out my abusive mother, effectively forgot about my poor father (I still regret this) and lived my fairytale. Bliss. We got married and had our first son. I felt like I had been pulled from my own life and dropped into a parallel world. By now, parents were divorced. Thank God. 

My wife knew my story from the outset and suggested I get some mental health guidance. I did and it did nothing but open a can of worms. I hated the world. I hated everyone bar her and was easily triggered by a whiff of infidelity, whether it be on TV or hearing about it through work colleagues. 

I eventually had a mental breakdown. Second son was born shortly after. Divorce was never mentioned. Intensive therapy meant intensive meds. I was diagnosed with CPTSD and BPD. I still to this day suffer flashbacks. My wife was and remained a wall of support, through addiction to Rx drugs - anti-psychotics (thanks to UK medical system) and benzos. Lots of alcohol. She went back to work and I had another breakdown. Our life started to fall apart. Sex has always been a crutch and the way I connect. It became too much and she told me so. I tried to reduce my libido and not bother her. In the end, vanilla sex was all we had. It became less and less frequent to the point that she told me that she just was not as interested in it as I was and tried everything to get me to see that constant sex did not mean a happy relationship. 

I found a sex toy of hers, a new one. I raged, triggered over the past. Was it just a sex toy or a lover? I  ended up self harming while she was at work. Never had I done such a thing, slashed my arms. 

We talked, we healed. Briefly. I carried on with my addiction. I became eternally paranoid SHE was being unfaithful. The sex toy was not the catalyst, as I had accused her before and all she replied with was with love and reassurance. Letters, begging and pleading for me to see that she was nothing of my past. But that was not enough. I became paranoid, frequently accusational. Yelling and screaming, calling her names with absolutely zero evidence and therefore wearing her down. I had security cameras installed because I was so hell bent on catching something that did not exist. I became my ex.

ABUSIVE. 

My stress got so bad, I had a fucking stroke at 30. Not a bad one but enough to fuck up my memory and speech/vision/hearing etc. And I did that to myself. I wish it had taken me. I really do. 

Fast forward to present day and we have emigrated from the UK to the US. I remain traumatized from my ex, the past. But here is the thing. That fairytale? Dead as you would imagine. She has tried to leave me three times now. Each time, I have 'hoovered' her (her words). The last time she tried, it hurt so bad I nearly ended up in the hospital. I acknowledge that this is selfish, but the fear of losing her felt like new trauma. I threatened suicide.  I acknowledge that this abusive. 

Once again, she has given me another chance. But the final one. No ifs, no buts. The last layer of ice. 

I am guilty of being everything that was given to me. I hate myself. I have never cheated. I fear she has. She tells me she is not that kind of person. I believe her. My illness makes me not. I worry, I fret. I look for things that are most likely not there.

The other day, we had good, passionate sex. But her body smelled like cologne  and not mine. (strangely on her thighs and nowhere else?) - Earlier that evening after I got home, she almost ran into the bedroom while I was in there getting changed. She initially said she was looking for a shirt she forgot to put in the washer. Later she changed that to ""I was just coming to see you, say hi.""

The better part of my mind says I am paranoid and I have no reason to believe what I think I am seeing here. She works from home and this is another issue. 

I am at the end of the line here. Even if I did end this relationship, I would never be able to have a functional relationship with anyone - nor would I want to risk fucking up another innocent soul. My kids are now fed up with the arguing and I am worried the cycle is endless. I am scared that they will not be able to have functional relationships if I don't do something. And pretty fucking quick. 

Help me, fellow redditors. I am a lost soul, guilty as charged but am pulling out all the stops to save a marriage and my children's future from complete ruin.  I am NOT, REPEAT NOT suicidal. Say what you want I will not respond to abusive comments. No one is perfect. I simply need some kind of advice. TIA.",mentalhealth,2021-01-21 16:22:24

so, sometimes, I would just gaze out into nothing in particular and...focus back on life. however, after I do that, I always feel disoriented for a few seconds. it's as if I'm not actually there. I'm just floating in this place and witnessing everything from a glass observational room. and THEN In those moments, when I look around my surroundings, I feel wrong. like I'm not supposed to be here. Like I've never been here before and I don't recognize anything. and then I panic, but then the 'memory' that I'm here comes back.

I also find myself thinking sometimes, ""wait, people are real. They have emotions..."". because of this, I often feel lonely. because, y'know, people aren't real. I feel like I'm *here*, walking among the people who are *not* real. Then I again feel scared. There's also a voice in the back of my head that sometimes tells me not to talk to people about this- but uh- yes. I feel like I do need to talk about this

I finally decided to take time from work for the stress/anxiety that has built up for the last couple months to the point it started to cause me physical issues. I speak with my manager and they approve 2 weeks off. I then realize I will need some more time and contact my HR dept. They approve a FMLA leave for 30 days \[including the initial 2 weeks\] and I informed them that I hadn't found any DR. for an appt. yet, they say its fine as long as I get the paper work back to them within 15 days. 

All great, until I try to actually find help in that time. I have new insurance so have to go through 20 doctors to find 1 that can even do a new patient apt. for late January. I get the paper work that needs doctor approval which would be due the 28th. Can't find any in person support for mental health in my area that accepts my insurance.

I try and use the virtual DR. service my insurance provides, speak with a therapist who felt like little help in the short session she had open and was unable to approve a leave; recommends a psychiatrist. Speak with a DR. about my physical issues and he prescribes me medication, but similarly not willing to approve the leave. Decide to finally speak with a psychiatrist; asks me basic direct questions never really going further, he diagnoses me with clinical depression and anxiety, prescribes medication and a follow up a month later. When I ask about help with the FMLA leave, get told its too much work and not something he'd recommend. I pretty much tell him that I am at a breaking point and its the entire reason I did this in the first place, he asks direct questions again finally says he would approve it for Feb-March, but it can take weeks to get it back to me. 

I am now sitting here unsure what to do; I feel like I should never have bothered trying in the first place and just suffered through. I don't know if I can even get approval for my initial leave for Jan. Unsure if I want to bother taking the extended leave, or medication. I felt as if finally trying to get help wasn't any help and has caused me more stress than before.",mentalhealth,2021-01-21 16:26:36

Currently, my roommate is out of town. So after work (I get out of work at 12pm) I decided to feed my dogs, and instead of walking them like I do right out of work, to take a bath. 1:30. I was in the bath. Now it’s 4:30. I’m not having a mental breakdown, I just love being in the bath! It’s so cold where I am, I am finding its warm relaxing. 

I don’t want to get out. I am writing this in the bath. The past hour I’ve been just thinking “I need to get out and do something productive” but I don’t. I’ve don’t need to do anything right now at all. I can relax. I can take a day off from walking my dogs. If I’m feeling at peace taking a day in the bathtub for four hours, I can! I’ve run out of hot water four times already, haha. 

Just know, I am currently in my happy place, and you should be too. If you feel unproductive, being productive could bring you happiness. But taking a day and relaxing should NOT make you feel guilty.

I live in Sydney, which you might have heard had a bit of a COVID flare-up recently, not huge, especially compared to most other places but enough to put a bunch of restrictions back into place. So I work as a bartender and as you can guess 90% of the restrictions are on bars and pubs or whatever which naturally means very low foot traffic, which is a good thing, I don’t actually want people going out to drink in the middle of a pandemic, but it also means that my shifts have been cut to almost nothing. Worse still, when I am at work I end up getting sent on break a lot more to save the company money, some nights for as long as 2 hours of unpaid breaks. Other nights it seems like they’re ignoring all the restrictions and allowing huge numbers in the door to make up for lost profit (last Friday it was shoulder to shoulder in the main room of the venue from 5pm until about 11:30pm) but despite allowing those numbers they’re only rostering a skeleton crew of staff, including axing security staff entirely. 

Before the restrictions I worked all the public holidays around Christmas and New Years expecting to get paid double time cause that’s the law here in NSW, only to find out I’d apparently signed some enterprise agreement when I started, forgoing any extra loading for public holidays (I also don’t get extra pay on Saturday and Sunday, again kinda an industry standard here, but I already knew about and agreed to that when I started).

We’ve also been accused of “stealing” by management in Facebook group chats because people were free pouring certain alcohols (heard this is pretty normal most places in the world, but NSW has the strictest alcohol laws in the world to my knowledge). Because of this “theft” we were all forced to undergo an exam they wrote up to prove we knew the measurements of all the cocktails on the menu, the punishment for failure being immediate termination. 

To top it all off this week I’ve gotten a bunch of messages from coworkers telling me they’ve been let go outta the blue, and now I’m just waiting to hear the same thing, never being sure whether I’m walking out for the last time after each shift.

I guess it’s just really stressing me out, I’d quit but as it is I’m not getting paid enough to cover basic living costs, having to drain my savings just to buy food. I’ve looked for other work but it’s obviously not a great market at the moment and the only thing I’ve got experience in is bartending, which obviously is an almost nonexistent job market right now.

Just not really sure what to do about it right now I guess.",mentalhealth,2021-01-21 16:51:31

Hello. In the past months while stuck at home, I've started to worry about my mental heath. I have never been diagnosed and I have never been to a therapist or anything of the sort. I am worried that I may have anxiety or something that related to psychosis/schizophrenia. I understand that you cannot make any diagnoses from what I will tell you, I just need advice of what I should do going forward.  


Some things I've experienced:

I felt like I started hearing things but when I asked the people around me they didn't hear it. I've had suspicions that their is something or someone out there ""trying to get me"". Other times I'll look around almost as if there was someone there. I'll stop doing activities out of fear that they will kill me, like the water in my house is tainted so I won't drink it. I've also had varying suicidal thoughts every now and then that are starting to become complex plans. My grades have started to slip and I'm losing motivation to do anything. I feel like I've started to get more irritated around others too.

I am fairly young (teens) and too nervous to tell my parents because I'm worried they'll call me crazy. I would really like to see a therapist or a psychologist to help me out.

I assumed he was physically sick and just sent him a text telling him to get well soon. We aren't the type of friends to stay in contact all the time, sometimes we go a few weeks without talking which is why I didn't know about this.
He proceeded to tell me that he had experienced ""something called psychosis"" and that it was an eye-opening experience because he ""finally understands the world"". Then he told me that he had met a 34 year old woman and is in a relationship with her (not sexually though) and he also came out to me as bi. For some reason he said that he found out that he is a genius and he understands humans perfectly and can analyse anyone's personality if he wants to (he has always been socially awkward). When he said he was a genius I didn't know that he was in the hospital and assumed that he took an IQ test to which he replied that he didn't. It was just something that ""he knows deep inside"".

After that he told me that he was in the hospital and has been for about 2 weeks now.. he said he isn't allowed to leave until they let him but for some reason he sounded (in some audio messages) really happy and optimistic (like he was maybe on medication?). He said strange things like: I just finally understand life and I finally understand myself and now I can live in peace and use my genius correctly, or something like that. He doesn't seem like himself at all but he said that I played a huge role in this experience for him. I don't know why he was admitted yet but he has already asked me to come visit him. I politely declined due to my full schedule but he really wants to talk to me on the phone tomorrow and tell me everything.
I don't know what he has been diagnosed with but he only mentioned psychosis.
I don't know how to act... I feel like saying the wrong things could maybe make his situation worse and I don't know how to talk to someone in that state of mind.

I'm a bit concerned with a recent experience I've had that's been playing on my mind. First of all I should note that I do have Schizoid Personality Disorder, and have thus had a history with mental health services that relate to this. I should clarify right off the bat, I do not believe that this experience is related to the aforementioned disorder, it's far too different and strange. I'd also like to note that I understand the first thing to do in a situation like this is to contact mental health services; I've already done so, and that's gonna' start to go through whenever, I'm mostly looking to get some reinforcement here.

I don't really know quite how to explain the experience other than 'I met another version of myself'. I was reading a book when I heard a knock at the window, I look up, and outside the window I see me. Not wearing the same clothes as I was, not like a reflection, I saw another version of myself at my window. After a second of obvious confusion I opened the window and we spoke. I honestly don't remember the exact words of what we spoke about, only that this other me was about as confused as I was, but that he remembered having the conversation before. After a minute or two he walked away and out of sight.

I live alone, and so I just kind of stood there like an idiot for about a minute before going to the door and looking outside. I couldn't find anything, so I went back in. I immediately got the immediate answers out of the way, the classic 'carbon monoxide' poisoning reddit likes to mention, etc. but I'm honestly at a loss for words.

&amp;#x200B;

Ever since I was a kid, if I was a little tired and took a nap I would sometimes go into this strange sleep. I don't consider it a deep sleep, I can hear everything around me and I can move my fingers and move around a bit and I know I am in some kind of rest mode (I feel refreshed after getting up)

&amp;#x200B;

Ok so now what is strange about it? well I don't sleep talk but when I am in this mode I sometimes cry or say a few words, and when I was a kid it would warp my reality, sometimes it was stupid stuff like I took out the garbage (in the dream I did, but a few hours pass and my mom is asking why I didnt take out the garbage (it would take really dark turns and I would think it happened). It also makes me feel time differently, like I can sleep a half hour or a hour and a half and it feels like I been alsleep for 3-8 hours)

&amp;#x200B;

So I rarely take naps and I am 30ish now, but the people I am with said I was crying (I remember seeing my mom and was happy but then realized in that trance state , that she had passed away hence I thought I was crying in the half sleeping mode but it verbal?) This was a few months ago.

&amp;#x200B;

It happened again today and as I said I can hear everything around me as I slept, but my mind keeps moving to new situations and dreams and I noticed that in that dream I felt like I saw these childhood friends not too long ago and there were false memory's where I visited them and that and hanged out(I haven't seen them for over 16 years....) I woke myself up because I knew it was false but it felt like my mind was trying to make them as fact.

&amp;#x200B;

I know this sounds weird or strange and I probably explained it badly, but has anyone have this happened to them? WTF is that about. It really pisses me off a lot honestly and why I refuse to take naps. but my living situation has changed drastically the last year)",mentalhealth,2021-01-21 17:30:22

Basically, one of her main issues is that she ‘needs’ validation from men in order to feel ‘worthy’. 

I’m not a psychologist but I reckon this is probably because her parents were very distant with her in her early life (they never said they loved her, one of her first memories is her mum holding a knife and shouting at her). 

I was just basically hoping someone could give some advice because all I’ve said is that she needs to try and love herself before wanting other people to.

The fight escalates and it seems floodgates open. The friend starts describing my personality in unflattering ways and then proceeds to say ""that's what years of isolation does to the brain"". Quite frankly, I was disgusted anyone would dare speak to me in this manner.

The reason I am disgusted is because someone is trying to use psychology to harm, not help. Basically out of anger and to try to shame me or degrade me. And second, these topics are extremely private matters to be shared with someone you feel safe with and trust, not during a fight against your will and to attack.

The other reason I felt disgusted was because this person has consumed mental health services in the past and I thought that would mean they wouldn't say such things. I guess I was wrong.

Another reason I felt annoyed (this isn't really disgust) is the confidence with which it was said. Oversimplifying my life and not an accurate portrayal of it. Other things said made me think this person seems to wrongly assume they know everything about me. They also told me another thing and said ""the fact that it bothers you means it's true"" which I heavily disagree with.

I just think it's a disgusting thing to say to anyone on the planet, true or not.

Isolation is a part of many mental health disorders, and to use it as an insult makes my skin crawl. And ""isolation"" can be used as an exaggeration of someone who is for example an introvert.

I'd appreciate the opinions of others about this. I don't feel I've fleshed out completely why it bothers me. Maybe hearing from others would help me articulate things I can't. And if you think it's fine to say such a thing, also please let me know.

I recently got into an argument with my moms husband about some family drama. I’ve been nice to him up until this point, and my first point of contention years back was the weekend after Anthony Bourdain’s suicide, upon which he made a disgusting comment about his suicide (which he repeated in his text to me just now below). At the time, I was cordial, because I wanted my mother to be happy with someone who cares about her and wants to be with her, so for her sake, I kept my mouth shut. Recently, I brought up to my mother that this was my first point of contention with him, especially since I’m someone myself whose battling depression and has struggled with suicidal thoughts. She brings it up with him, and now I got this text from him. I just wanna ask, am I being gaslighted about depression and suicide? [I left my name out below as a matter of privacy, I inserted [me] in place of it]:

“Regarding Anthony Bourdain and even Robin Williams for that matter...I use to be big fans of both individuals. I’m allowed to be pissed that they chose to kill themselves. Yes, depression is a disease and it sucks and it affects many people, some worse than others. It doesn’t mean that it’s ok to kill yourself or that suicide should be condoned. The media spends too much time sensationalizing celebrity suicide and not enough time talking about the people who work their ass off to pick themselves off the floor and turn their lives around. Bourdain and Williams had family, friends and fans who would have done anything to support them. Instead they chose to be selfish and kill themselves. The definition of selfish is lacking consideration of others. These individuals made a decision which caused their families and others to be hurt and to live in regret wondering what they could have done to help. What’s worse, is the impact on all the regular people, who suffer from depression that idolized these folks. No one ever talks about the copy cat suicides that result from celebrities killing themselves. People that work hard to turn their lives around are my hero's. Those who do the opposite and take the easy way out, I feel, are the opposite of hero’s which if you look it up, would be cowards. I’m allowed to have my opinion. I’ve had a close acquaintance in college who killed himself. I also watched my mom who died at 40 of cancer fight with all her might unsuccessfully to stay alive when she could have given up. Just because I think Anthony Bourdain is a selfish coward doesn’t mean that I spat in the face of everyone that has suffered with depression. It’s a silly argument. I don’t see how you can connect the dots. I was talking about Anthony Bourdain. I wasn’t talking about you or anyone else for that matter. If you said something about a person with red hair, I wouldn’t be offended because every person with red hair is not the same. And if I were offended by something you said then I would talk to you about it instead of walking around angry. I feel bad that you suffer from depression.

Escapism is a mental diversion from unpleasant or boring aspects of daily life, typically through activities involving imagination or entertainment. Escapism may be used to occupy one's self away from persistent feelings of depression or general sadness. 

I think I could say I deal with this pretty hard.

I mean I’m not sure if I even enjoy life I want to LIVE but It feels like I’m just breathing as it stands the only enjoyment I get comes from reading/playing games to stop thinking about what will go on in the future.

I don’t think I want kids. I'm not a people person. I'm not sure if I even want a ‘partner’ so to say.

It’s just our world’s boring. I guess that’s why I’m so driven to fantasy my two hobbies are just me escaping to another world so I can enjoy something. 

Personally I struggle to find joy in a lot of things. I mean I’m growing up yeah I’ll be 17 in a couple months from which I’m planning on dropping out.

School isn’t/hasn’t been for me for years the longer I stay in it the worse my mental state gets. I really can't bring myself to care for it at all anymore.

I got into games early and reading a bit later.

Reading I guess is one of the biggest things that led me to this mindset.

I think what got me fully hooked on reading and I guess fantasy as a whole was “Fablehaven” by “Brandon Mull” in the 4th grade the world just hooked me ya know?

From there as years went on I enjoyed school less and less. I started understanding things less. I found it harder to make friends. I didn’t really have anyone. I guess I had my parents and brother. Me and my Brother have never really shared interests, sure we both enjoyed games but that’s where the list ends. School was just... I could talk to people and hold a conversation but I just bounced friend groups trying to find one.

Like sure I’ve had friends but they never stuck besides a few even then I don’t think it’ll last. I'm just not good with people. I prefer solitude.

That’s how it went on for years until I just gave up and put all the time I could into reading and playing games since that’s the only way I could find some enjoyment.

But I’m aiming on getting a G.E.D. and after that do I just live? 

I guess this could be cause I’m terrified of going into adulthood and don’t realize it?

But if I’m not enjoying life itself even if I want to live in the end I’m just breathing not living.

I’ve spent a lot of time going to war with myself and it isn't fun. I've had thoughts I wish I wouldn't due to how little I love this world. I wonder how things would have gone if I didn't love my parents as much as I do. Or if I just ended up with shitty parents. Damn I got lucky in that department.

Scared to admit it but I didn't have the parents I do. I don’t think that I would even be typing this. The biggest thing keeping me from even considering it is I just love my parents, I think it’s an easy way out, and I really want to read the next chapter of that web-novel or the next book in the series!

Things aren't made easier due to my ADHD. I have anger issues I’ve gotten better at controlling.

I have insomnia and it sucks sleeping is hard even with medicine and the nights I do sleep I have nightmares sometimes wake up in the middle of the night and can’t go back to sleep.

Majority of my school years I went to school daily with 1-4 hours of sleep so I was never even able to pay attention. I struggled keeping myself awake. Later on I just became a kid who sat on his phone in class and if it got taken up, died, or I just wanted to prevent it getting jacked for the day I would day-dream the entire period.

And when I’m awake I devolve into reading to keep my mind out of my head and enjoy what people write. 

In the end I’m not sure what I should do. I could try and “Find my path” but how long would that take or would it even happen?

In the end I’m lost. I guess I have some plans like what career I want to go into but in the end I’ll just be breathing and not living. In that case I hope I die early if I don’t find my path.

I just don't want to spend my whole life searching for what might not even be there like the whole debate “would you rather live a long life or a short and happy life” and I pick second option it isn't a thought I hate feeling lost it’s confusing I really wonder if it’s worth trying to find the path.",mentalhealth,2021-01-21 18:31:46

we've been in lockdown since last march and i haven't been to school since. online school doesn't work for me. i didn't. learn. a. thing. i chose a very difficult college.i guess i just wanted to go in because it has a good name. i wasn't sure what major to take. i ended up with one that i didn't know too much about it, just that it'd get me where i want with my future job. (idk if the major is also somewhere else but not sure if it's the job for me. it sounded great when i imagined it but is it something that i *want* to do? something i'll *enjoy* doing? sounded interesting and looked cool in movies but) i was supposed to write admission tests but since corona happened, i didn't and most of us got in. i have a feeling that if i did write them, i wouldn't get in.

i thought i could probably major in anything and somehow make it. i'm not sure if it's the online situation or me choosing the wrong major. my classes don't interest me one bit, i'm dreading my next semester because all the people there are from specialized schools and i haven't heard/seen most of these things, never worked in a lab. i feel like i am so behind. 

i'm having my first final tomorrow and am writing this pretty much in the middle of a mental breakdown. i barely dragged myself through 3 hour long lectures that are filled to brim with greek letters and formulas and nothing else. i feel like i'm going to absolutely fail. and then more tests. i feel like my mental health has taken such a plunge,  i can't concentrate. i feel like i'm so stressed and stuck and can't do anyhting but at the same time, feel like i'm wasting every second i'm not studying. my whole being is such a wind whirl, i can't put it into words.

this, unfortunately lead to s\*lf h\*rm. i sound so pathetic but i didn't know what else to do with myself. i honestly feel like everyone would be better off if i disappeared. i don't want my parents to see me as a failure, i don't want to just be a dead weight on their shoulders, i don't want to make life harder for them. but college is dragging me down so bad. i'm considering dropping out or taking one year off. but i don't know what else i'd study. i'd like to go work somewhere but everything's closed and i'm not a senior programmer (or at least that's all the jobs i could find). what's worse is that my college is 8 hours away in a different country, i hate my dorm with passion and they're changing their regulations so much, i end up traveling up and down for 16 hours just to do one lab session and then they close again. i've been there for 2 or so days, just go there, sleep, come back maybe 3 times since december. 

i have to go back because of one test. just one. i don't want to, i don't have the energy to but i know i must go. i don't want to disappoint anyone. i don't want to be the shame. i know my parents are having problems with my sibling who is also suffering from a few mental health problems. i saw the toll it took on them and they don't deserve the same from me. i feel like i'm failing in life. being 'kinda smart' was the one thing i had going for me and i can't even complete a stupid uni course without breaking down like this.

i'm always jumping between 'i'll finish college just fine' and 'i can't go through 15 more minutes of this' in a span of like 15 minutes. i'm telling myself i'm probably mentally completely fine and just making shit up for attention or something. but then i think s\*lf h\*rm and considering suicide probably aren't the signs of a healthy mind. i don't know whether i shoud go see a specialist but i also do not want to make anyone pay for one. i feel like everyone would be better off without me and my bullshit.  i just don't know what to do, to me i should like a little whiny bitch but i don't know if i have it in me to tough it out. it feels like my head is in a twister and i can't think straight, can't concentrate and honestly, if i could just poof away, i would. idk if something's wrong with my head and i don't know what to do",mentalhealth,2021-01-21 18:42:48

I’ve almost lost all my reasons to live. Still don’t know if I’ll end up okay in the future.. hopefully this feeling will end soon in a positive result.

I would say that things were getting worse at the time I started getting treatment and I have not had significant improvement.

I'm 15M.
I've had sleep paralysis problems lately which has taken a big toll on my sleep schedule and my mental health. 

Let me quickly explain what sleep paralysis to those who aren't familiar. Sleep paralysis is a dream where you are mentally present in the dream but is completely unable to move or wake up (I was, we'll get into that). You'll be laying in bed looking around your room, only able to move your eyes. Some people hallucinate, hear sounds and feel pressure on their chest, some also have breathing problems.

In the current month I've had a couple sleep paralysis dreams. I hear stuff, i see stuff and I feel stuff. My mental health has completely declined since. I'll go on days with a couple naps (2~ hours per nap)


Had 3 dreams total. First one lasted 15 seconds and i didn't think much of it. Second one lasted a minute or so and wasn't *that* bad either but not pleasent. Sounds and shit. However the third one was a little more... extreme. Won't go into details but I saw shit that made me scared or sleeping and now I'm trying to stay awake because I'm too scared of sleeping. It lasted, in my head, 3 minutes~. I was somehow able to move my finger which woke me up, luckily. It's unusual that people are able to move, even the slightest, during sleep paralysis. So that's nice.


How to get rid of or lessen the amount of sleep paralysis i have. Or at least make the content less... horrific.",mentalhealth,2021-01-21 19:25:52

i have never been diagnosed with anything/ever seen a specialist but, i just know some things i do aren't normal for my mental health. i've always definitely shown some sign of anxiety. i used to be extremly shy 'pleasure to have' in lessons kid. i mean, i'm still a pleasure, but overall i've gotten much more confident in the last two years. anyways. i'm just guessing this is an anxiety related thing (im 16 i dont know much these r just my suspicions) but sometimes i just /cant/ do things. like when i was12,13,14 i could never go into the fish and chip shop. like, with my own mother, i'd simply just refuse and when pushed i'd always tear up at the pure thought of doing it. of course, a few times i actually had to do and it was was always fine but each time without fail i /couldn't/ go in there. and i know what i felt then was like a surge of anxiety. i think if i was in that situation again i'd not be okay. i'm actually super confident sometimes - fake it until you make it type beat - but sometimes it just hits where i feel all that anxiety again about things. like i physically /cannot/ do this.

i also struggle with extreme self loathing. i hate myself. i'm always the one saying im the best and everything i do is great (all in jokes though) and honestly its very conflicting.

yesterday i had my first ever panic attack. it was an extremely weird experiance. it was before my online history lesson. earlier that day some of my friends hosted a little facetime 'intervention' because they said i seemed sad lately. this is only because i posted like two days in a row where i was crying on my priv story (embarrassing i know) and usually i never broadcast it when im sad (i hate sharing about it, i just deal with everything myself) so i guess why they'd be a tad concerned. i completely brushed it off and deflected - i turned it into something funny by talking about something different. i soon put myself on mute on the facetime then left because i really didn't feel up to it. back to history. originally i wasn't going to join because i felt a bit suffocated (i told myself i was just being dramatic) but i joint anyways albeit a few minutes late. two minutes go by and i just knew something wasn't right. i can'tdescribe how i felt. i quickly messaged my friends and i's history group chat saying 'hey can you tell sir my wifis being dodgy' because, well, its a classic excuse. obviously my friends all know my wifis fine. this is when it all really hit. i was crying which proggressivley got worse (sobbing) and i was very short of breath. like gasping for air. this lasted for a while, all during it i kind of tried to move around and i had to steady myself on my desk, the floor, my chair. in the moment i had no idea what was happening to me. i couldn't breathe, it was extremely difficult. i felt nauseaous before it started and quite sweaty during. i thought during, is this a panic attack? but then thought no, i've never had one, i'm fine. obviously i realised that was very wrong. still confused about it all, i went to the bathroom to blow my nose (got quite snotty sorry) and i had a super dry mouth. when i reached for my cup for water i noticed my hand was trembling slightly. my hands don't shake. ever. i think that was when it hit me that oh my god was that actuall a panic attack? my teeth were also tingling a lot as soon as the worst of it was over. my heart was beating quite fast (not hard). it all lasted for about ten minutes. it was awful and the fact that i've never had that gasping for breath situation happen to me i just knew it was a panic attack. my friends asked why iwasnt in history and i said (after it was done) i think i had a panic attack. oviously they all reached out to me and confirmed it because i was still confused. two of my friends still don't know and i'm worried to tell them because it's already haeppned (what if they think im dragging it out?) and i feel as though they'd never expect /me/ to have a panic attack. dumb thoughts i know because these two friends have had them before but idk. i also haven't told my parents yet. i love them, we have the best relationship, but i just haven't told them. i'm a deal it with myself person and now because it's already been a day since it happened, what if they feel hurt i didn't tell them immediately?

anyways. i can't get into all my feelings and thoughts because that is too much to unpack and admit to myself.

Let me explain from the perspective of someone who asked too many questions. Many times in class. I don't. I try not to for obvious reasons. It can be disruptive. I took up a musical theatre degree course but I'm not a naturally kinesthetic person. The classes, especially dance and piano playing or singing were....difficult. I've always been someone who did better in cognitive studies (mind stuff), literature and researching on theories than I was at....my body.

I was natural with acting. 
Yet when it came to singing and performing the intentions or whatever, I just couldn't....show it!

I would ask about a dance move or a application onto the piano playing only to literally forget after they left. I could not retain the information. I would ask all these questions. Did I improve? Is this move right? Constantly because I was so used to understanding concepts and things immediately. Im really not trying to come across as bragging, I'm just saying this I thought I was genuinely stupid. I took a mensa test and was within the 92nd percentile. I was so confused. Why would I be so horrible at this then??

I would practice by myself but forget almost instantly. It was as though my body and mind were two separate entities. 

I didn't know what to do. 

So apparently almost all the teachers were kinda annoyed at me. And I felt bad. I didn't purposely mean to come across as annoying or frustrating. During literature class it was fantastic because I could get things and questions were welcome. 

I must say I was a teacher before this and by god this must have meant I had infinite patience because I loved questions. I could answer 100 of them because I loved curious kids even if there was a time limit.

So. Now I dont know what to do. I feel bad. I feel shit. I also can't...connect with other students and I feel isolated and THAT makes me feel shit too. Like oh my god. People. I do. Not. Know. How. To communicate with people my age. Socialise with them or be in a clique. Why must they be in a clique? Why do they isolate?. Yet I can be extremely friendly to elderly or kids and communicate fine. 

I don't know. I sometimes wonder if there is a particular condition I have. Sometimes I feel like Mycroft Holmes with obviously less intelligence, other times I feel like in just a girl trying to get by on a course she  initially wanted to challenge herself in but is realising it's really hard to. Sigh. please help. I really considered being a hermit or hikkikomori if this failed. People really hurt.",mentalhealth,2021-01-21 19:36:21

For a little more than 18 months my wife struggled deeply with depression and PTSD.  During that time she attempted suicide six times, once about every three months.  She tried injecting herself with an entire vial of my insulin, held a loaded gun to her head, thought about jumping from a bridge and sat in her car with a years worth of prescriptions.  Three of the attempts landed her in the mental health ward overnight but none resulted in any sort of longer term commitment.  She resisted counseling and to this day won’t see a therapist.

The good news is she tried some alternative things such as reiki and working with a spiritual healer and she has been much better over the past three months.  There haven’t been any more attempts or long drawn out episodes of depression and anger.

Each of the episodes during those 18 months stemmed from insecurity and PTSD related to her abusive parents but I became the target of all her fear and angst.  During her episodes many horrible things happened.  She punched me, bit me, kicked holes in our walls, pointed that same gun at me, and verbally attacked me for hours and sometimes days on end.  She screamed and attacked my friends and my family until they’ve all pulled back.  She was convinced my best friend of 23 years’ wife was trying to have an affair with me and openly accused her on social media ruining my friendship with him.  I started seeing a therapist for about four weeks to cope with the stress of what our family was going through but had to stop because she was convinced the therapist was telling me to leave her (she wasn’t). My life is shadow of what it once was and I suffer quietly because I’m worried that saying anything or trying to repair some of the fractured relationships will send her spiraling again.

As I wrote earlier, she seems happier and to be doing better but I’m broken.  I’m isolated from anyone who would have been a support system so I suffer quietly.  What really has me feeling especially low was a FB post of hers about two months ago.

I think she was trying to publicly praise me but honestly it had the opposite affect.  The just of the post was her saying that she doesn’t give me enough credit for sticking with her through her illness and then she listed all of the things she’s done to me over those 18 months.  It was embarrassing but more heartbreaking because all of the comments were praising her fighting through her illness and for putting it out there for everyone to see.  Not one person said anything about me or checked on me or told her what she had done was wrong.  As a guy, I can only imagine if I had posted that I’d hit and kicked and but my wife - I don’t think I would have received kudos for admitting it.  In the end the post just made me feel more isolated comes across as her bragging about what she ‘got away with’.

For the past two months her mood has continued to improve and I love her and want to continue to support her.  I want to forgive her but I’m struggling since most of the consequences from her episodes are mine to bear (loss of friends and family).

Any advice on how to forgive?",mentalhealth,2021-01-21 19:48:09

I need help from people who have been there.  My partner and I have been together 4 years.  He comes from bad relationships where ppl gaslight him, physically abuse him and mentally abuse him.  He still has to deal with his latest ex as they share a child.  He hasnt had a relationship longer than 4 years.  I come from a really long relationship of 18 years where I was groomed from when I was 17 onwards by someone who was abusive in ALL ways.  I have complex ptsd because of him.  I also have it because before I met him I lived with my cruel mother.  There are certain things I would call a deal breaker in a relationship and anything my ex did is on that list.  A while ago I told my now partner that there are certain things to never say to me....ever.  Shut Up is one of them.  2 nights ago he told me to shut up.  I did interrupt him when I promised not to and we were arguing about an issue that arose earlier that caused a LOT of emotional distress for me and considering the circumstances I didnt handle it well at all.  I shouldve walked away but I really wanted him to understand my side.  I felt I wasnt being listened to and this is something that tends to happen a lot.  The moment he told me to shut up I shattered.  He called me crazy and said he was done with me.  I took off my engagement ring and put it on the bed beside him and left in a rage.  The rage happened after I told him I will never allow him to say shut up to me and thats when he started calling me crazy and emotional.  I was red hot mad and slammed the door.  I slammed it 2x so hard that the paint separated from it.  I ran downstairs and tried looking up someone I could call for help and realised I have no one..just him.  I sank even lower.  My daughter convinced me to talk to him and I went down to do so.  I appoligised for slamming the door and getting upset.  I reiterated that saying shut up to me is a huge thing and his response was that it wasnt to normal people.  Normal people.  I dont know what to do with that.  I know it as abuse and I told him that.  He explained it away and refused to acknowledge the effect.  We have been somewhat avoiding eachother for 2 days.  He asked for space and I respected that.  Tonight he came to talk to me about that moment.  He said he isnt ok with my ""freakout"" or ""meltdown"".  He said it reminded him of who he dated before and he is concerned I will do that again.  Fair of course.  I also stated that I also cant move past him telling me to shut up and how much it hurt.  He told me its not the same and he doesnt see what he did as being anywhere near as equal to what I did to him.  We were in couples counselling and that seems to have made things worse.  We are at a standstill.  I asked and we are still ""together"" but he doesnt want to do anything at this point and says he needs time.  I do to and Ive been enjoying the space we have right now as I have a hard time with any conflict.  We both acknowledge we have issues.  Me most of all because I dont want to be this person who gets triggered.  I go to therapy as well.  Ive taken all the advice I can and made so many changes that I dont know who I am anymore.  I dont know what to do.  I dont want to loose him but I dont want to continue in something that can turn into something so ugly all over for me again.  I told him that I dont want to have to worry about him saying something because he was angry and triggering me and he said he doesnt want to worry about me freaking out, yelling and slamming doors.

I have questions.,"I’m a 14 year old girl who struggles with anorexia. I developed anorexia around a year ago and ever since have had many medical admissions. A 1 month psych admission and a 3 week psych admission + other admissions for suicidal ideation etc...

When I developed anorexia I was overweight. I became addicted to exercise and was restricting my calories a lot. Constantly deadly conscious of my body appearance (body dysmorphia) 
I lost almost half of my body weight in a year and eventually was diagnosed with anorexia nervous even though my weight was always in the “healthy range” even at my lowest. Everyone says I’m very slim and I don’t know if I need weight restoration at home or not. The meal plan they put me on in my admissions was a very high calorie one. (Over three thousand five hundred cals) (I was losing weight whilst in hospital though) that’s why I was on such a high calorie meal plan.

Anyway to get to the point I still feel a huge urge to exercise after every meal, I calorie count and want to lose weight. I’m having 3 main meals and 3 snacks a day but they are all limited in calories. I’m always hungry and just want this eating disorder voice to go away. I get psychiatric treatment but it doesn’t help
I have some questions though. (Please be nice, I’m struggling and just need some help) 

Will I gain weight by eating one thousand three hundred calories a day

Should I be on a higher calorie meal plan

How do I maintain my weight now!?

If I don’t exercise after a meal will I gain weight

Should my meals be all healthy or should I just eat whatever my body is craving or wanting even if it’s chocolate or takeaway

Even if I’m not underweight should I still be eating the amount I was eating in hospital.",mentalhealth,2021-01-21 19:49:11

A friend of mine, I'll call her C, suffers from lots of mental health issues. She has BDD (body dysmorphic disorder,) depression, anxiety, ADHD, and a processing disorder. The ADHD and processing disorder itself isn't the problem, the way that C thinks about herself because of it is the problem. Anyway, I would really like to know how I can help her. C always turns to me when things are happening but I never know how to help/respond. And when I do try to help, I usually say the wrong thing and she'll get mad at me. 

Another major problem with this is that I don't know how to help her when I can't even begin to help myself. Sometimes (most of the time) when she talks about what's going on (mainly when she's having a bad BDD day) I find myself spiraling into a really bad mental state. I don't know why, but her bringing up being self-conscious makes me think about how I look which eventually spirals into me hating myself or wanting to self-harm. I hate that this happens because I want to be there for her without putting my own self in danger but I don't know how to do that. She doesn't have anyone else to turn to so I *need* to be there for her.",mentalhealth,2021-01-21 19:53:49

Its kinda tough to describe this but I'm being as honest as possible. So over the past year I've been having incredibly bad intrusive thoughts. To the point in the summer when I wouldn't even go outside for a walk out of fear I might trigger these bad thoughts and it felt like I couldn't trust myself. I talked with a friend about it and they said I sound a lot like them and they have diagnosed OCD. Im not saying I have it or don't, but I do have these thoughts. The struggle is they cause anxiety so bad it deprives me of my ability to do just about anything.
 That leads me to now where I have these terrible thoughts about everything. For example I cant stop thinking that life is just worthless. but not for no reason, I keep thinking it because I just feel like in the end there really was no point to it all. One day it won't matter anyway. i know it sounds bad but i genuinely cant stop these thoughts. and they cause so much anxiety. Recently I also completely stopped feeling love for others. I used to always be on the lookout for ""the one"" trying to talk to girls all the time but now I feel absolutely nothing. No attraction or even care to find anyone. This then mixed with the intrusive thoughts and my brain started telling me if i dont love a girl anymore i must be gay even though i know im not. And that caused so much incredibly bad anxiety to the point where i would punch myself whenever i had intrusive thoughts so hard my head would ring. (i am not homophobic, but those were incredibly distressing thoughts. its hard to explain) 
I am not sure what happened. everything just went downhill over the summer. and im researching it and i can't figure out what is going on. Some things say it might be depression, some things say it might be schizophrenia, some things say it may be a cluster A personality disorder. and now im so anxious over if i have one of those. i only think i might have the last 2 because i dont like social things so much anymore. i kinda just wanna be alone and not talk to anyone. and there's this one project that im working on that i do enjoy but it's like I get addicted to doing that one thing (programming) - and that's a symptom of both paranoid and schizotypal personality disorder. I don't know what to do anymore.",mentalhealth,2021-01-21 20:14:23

I have social anxiety which I have been working on overcoming for a long time. I used to have panic attacks but I get them much less frequently now which is good.
however I always feel like there’s something else going on with me. My mum always just says that it’s hormones and mood swings and maybe it is just that but it’s been happening for a while and I’m 18 now so I’ve just started questioning what could be wrong with me or if I’m just overreacting.
First of all, I have really big mood swings. I often wake up in an awful mood and struggle to get out of bed, particularly in this lockdown I’ve found myself staying in bed all day and have been finding it hard to complete basic tasks or any of my college work.i have been crying a lot and I have found myself getting bouts of anger too for not really any reason ,at my family and my boyfriend.
secondly I have become extremely attached to my boyfriend and think about our relationship constantly. I often overthink and worry that he doesn’t love me anymore and he’s going to leave me. Sometimes it causes problems in our relationship. 
I feel like I really need help. Maybe it is just hormones or something but it’s just making me feel so sad and I feel like the sadness always comes back. I don’t really have anything in my past that could have caused me to feel this way and there is no one in my family that really has mental health problems. I tried going to the doctor about it but nothing really came of that. 
anyway I hope everyone has been feeling ok and isn’t struggling too much with everything going on. &lt;3",mentalhealth,2021-01-21 20:18:17

It's a manipulative, gaslighting, compulsive liar.

I've had a customer at my work for two years now. She works across the street and frequently comes in for lunch. I have had a squish on her the entire time. And even though I knew it was requited, even though my coworkers told me it was requited, even though every time she came in she actively sought me out to converse, somehow anxiety had convinced me that she would be put off if I ever asked to hang out.

After two years, I got my hair cut by her and we chatted away the entire time. We talked about serving and bartending in the past. I mentioned missing it and she immediately told me her boyfriend was a bar manager in a local restaurant and that I should apply there, I'd be a shoe-in. She even told me I should bring my hubby with me and visit her at her other job while she bartended. And still, anxiety told me no.

I was talking today with my boss about how unfair it is that it's socially acceptable to ask a stranger on a romantic date or into your bed even but yet if you have platonic intentions it's weird. She told me to just go for it, finally ask, that I would be pleasantly surprised. So I finally did. And guess what?

My anxiety was wrong.

My mood swings are awful and please if you are going to say ""it is because of your hormones. It is just a teenager thing"" i think i might scream. When i talk about mood swings i am talking about i will be crying wanting to kill myself then after i am done crying i will be listening to music feeling happy. Anything angers me and when i say anything i mean ANYTHING. My mum when started kissing the dog(on her head just when you love your pets) when she was still drunk and the noises coming from her dry annoying sounding fu*king mouth made me want to fu*king go mad. I was so angry i actually just felt like i was going to make her stop by smacking her or punching her or pulling her hair. It drove me insane. And the sounds and her mouth and the way she was doing it. FU*KKKKK. 

Then there is my dad when he also has a dry mouth and he opens and closes it and then because of the dry mouth it makes crackling noises and that also makes me want to kick off. And when he rubs his chin. That really really really annoys me. My mum drunk just causes me to explode and i  get so furious to the point where last time i walked out of the house at nearly 12 am and went to stay somewhere else. When she is drunk her eyes look like they will pop out of her skull and she stutters and i just really want to grab her by the hair and tell her to fu*k off.

 When i am angry i tend to hurt myself or i throw things or i hit things off the wall. Breathing also angers me ALOT. I cannot stand people breathing around me. Especially when they use their mouth instead of nose. I refuse to stay in a room with someone if i can hear their breathing. Another thing that angers me is clothes. If my jumpers itch me or when i put a coat on causes the coat to be too tight i will roughly take off the coat and probably hit it off something. I cannot wear socks as i hate the feeling of the piece of cotton that goes over your toes(the toe line part). Skinny jeans make me angry also. I hate the feeling of them on my legs. I cannot sleep with a sheet on the bed because if i feel one crinkleor anything under the sheets like a mattress topper out of place i will rip everything off of my bed and sleep on a bare matress like right now. Same with a duvet. 

I hate family members crying. It is so cringey and i hate hugging family members when they cry. Basically in general i hate comforting family when they are down but with friends i am fine. The smallest things can make me want to kill myself. A boy took advantage of me for nudes. That made me want to kill myself. My dad and i had an argument. Yep i wanted to kill myself. Anything said about my looks or weight. Yep you thought right. I.want.to.kill.myself. When i cry it is literally like i pitty myself and feel sorry and even then i think well that is so stupid.

 I over think EVERYTHING.Anything i do i must think about every consequence for my actions or what people might say or do or think because of my words or actions. I think about every possible way things could go down to the finer details. Also, i forgot to mention i cry alot when i am angry. My dad said to me once that i am like a time bomb waiting to explode. Both of my parents say that i have a bad temper. 

Just now one of my ""friends"" declined my call and has been ignoring them for a while. I burst into tears and i felt like calling him every name under the sun(apart from the racist and homophobic ones etc. So just swear words). I have very unstable relationships with people. This boy likes me. One minute i want to be all cute and sweet with him and the next minute i cringe and want to tell him to stop liking me because i hate it. I have anxiety and used to have depression. That is it really. Also my mental health center that i go to(but am now refusing) are a load of sh*t.",mentalhealth,2021-01-21 20:33:18

Basically, whenever I go to sleep, and I try to keep it consistent by going to bed at around 10 pm - 11 pm every night, I always end up getting woken up shortly after by either a nightmare or a sleep paralysis episode, and then I'm afraid to go back to sleep and I just lie awake the entire night. And then the next day I just feel like a zombie and I try to sneak in naps during work (luckily I have my own office). It's a terrible cycle and I don't know how to break it. 

My nightmares are often times so intense, as well as my sleep paralysis episodes, that I often wake up literally scared of everything in my room, every sound and every shape, everything. I'm usually a somewhat rational person and I don't believe in paranormal and that stuff, but when I wake up from a nightmare I feel scared for my life that I honestly sometimes think something is in my house. I sound insane, I know, but this is really how I feel.

Then I see other people post about their breakups with their boyfriends or family issues and they get so many comments and so many reactions.

But my issues are treated as trivial and stupid. hardly anyone cares about it and the people who do, comment as if my issue is something so simple where they just tell me just do this and your problem will be solved. I would not be depressed if my issue was something simple that I could easily solve. 

part of the thing that makes me depressed is knowing that no one cares about me. and posting on there doesn't really help because it just reinforces that it's not all in my head and that people really don't give a fuck about me.

I have been struggling with this situation for a while now and I could really appreciate some input and opinions. I (22f) think I may be autistic and I am not really sure how to proceed or deal with this thought. 
I'm in my third and last year of university now (engineering) and with every day passing (especially since the current situation started), I notice that something isn't quite right. 


I've always been the ""weird"" kind of kid: gifted, some peculiar interests (knitting patterns, trains, butterflies, US politics) from an early age, not popular but with few close friends, reacting strongly to new things (foods, feelings, some sounds), being kind of awkward at small talk but I always managed to blend in somehow and kept going even though it hurt. 

 When I started uni, I felt overwhelmed by so many new emotions. I wasn't used to not immediately succeeding at what I'm doing, to not being at home, to not have my parents, dog, and friends around, and to be alone all the time. 

I couldn't (and still can't) really process all these emotions at the same time, so I just kind of built a protective bubble around me. Before, I would just manage to blend in somehow but it would feel extremely exhausting. I vividly remember looking forward to going to a friend's party for weeks, enjoying it at first and then after some time just feeling overwhelmed by the whole turmoil so I snuck into a free room to hang out with her cat. 

With the current situation and so many changes and stress at once, I sometimes still manage to keep my facade up but one thing not going to plan (even something insignificant like losing at a video game) upsets me. Definitely not in a violent way but sometimes I'll just start crying because that's the only emotion I can come up with in that moment but after that, I feel ashamed. My boyfriend (also 22) said it is reflecting poorly on me if I just quit a game to cry which is probably right but I just don't know what else to do. I feel like I never really learned how to process my emotions in a healthy way. I also don't know if I should tell him about these feelings. On one hand, I would like him to know how I really feel but on the other hand, I don't really want to bother him with this. He's not a therapist and I don't want to be a burden when talking to him about something so serious. 
What would you do in my situation? 
I put some efforts into seeking a therapist to maybe get a diagnosis and professional advice but there is still a huge stigma around mental health issues in my country and due to the pandemic, waiting lists for ""non-life threatening problems"" are a year long.

She’s always stated “I’m not supposed to be here, I’m not supposed to be alive in this world.” We’ve gone through long term hospitalization, short term, partial hospitalization, intensive in home, one on one weekly therapy, support group therapy, art therapy, music therapy, etc. She recently came back home over the weekend from a two week hospitalization to get her meds adjusted. Since she’s been home she’s been overly anxious and hostile with everyone at home and school. She had called today from school crying that she just wanted to jump off the school building. When talking to her she doesn’t really give any reason why but yet doesn’t feel like she needs help. She started therapy and refuses to tell her therapist anything and will just smile and nod when they talk. Each hospitalization catches the therapist off guard because they do not know my daughter. I explained to her today that the psychiatrist may send her back if they feel that she wasn’t there long enough. I personally feel like she was released too soon because she had escaped the facility the night before after causing over $10,000 in damage with five other kids.

So, I go to therapy and have went to therapy (mainly for trauma, anger issues, and low self-esteem) for over a year or two. Recently, I've actually been lying to my therapist. I've been telling her half truths, like instead of saying I'm doing horribly I'll say I'm not doing the best but I'm still better then usual, when in reality everyday I constantly plan out what my suicide will look like and I even went so far as to write out a note in case I ever actually do something. My anger issues haven't really gotten all that better either, I've just stopped taking out my anger on people other then myself. So instead of hitting someone else, I'll punch myself untill my legs and arms are sore, and I'll bite my lips untill I can't anymore because of the pain, etc. But my therapist doesn't know that I'm lying. She said she was gonna discharge me from therapy after one or two more visits, because I met all my goals that I wanted to when I started therapy. Which is true, I have met pretty much all my goals, but that just means I need to make new goals because I still hate myself.
It even got to the point where I tried to kill myself two Sundays ago. I was extremely stressed all day that day, and I was having a moment where I just couldn't stand how I looked, couldn't stand my weight, couldn't stand how my face looks, just couldn't stand anything about me physically nor mentally, and that mixed with the fact that I had school the next day and I had a really important project due that I didn't care enough to even start and I would have to get up at six and just get up and get ready and pretend everything was ok and nothing was wrong even though nothing was. That was all just too overwhelming. I had this one reason to keep living for so long, but then my stepmom ruined that reason for me. The reason was that, if I died, who would tell my story? I couldn't just let my story be forgotten, could I?
But then one day, my stepmom got mad at me for some reason I can't remember, and informed me that my story and all that wasn't exactly uncommon, and that a lot of other kids had been though things very similar. She didn't mean to hurt me, but that just shattered me. The one thing I felt special or important for was just ripped away from me, and apparently had never mad me special nor important in the first place. So I ended up trying to kill myself. I don't know if it counts as a suicide attempt though, because I'm a stupid eleven year old (I know, I know, I shouldn't be on reddit, I'm sorry, I just never have anywhere else to post my art or things like that because I never have motivation to make posts on many other platforms.) And I'd never done anything like that before, so I didn't cut anywhere deep enough. But I still wish more then anything that I didn't fail.

Anyway, I don't know what to do, because if I say that I'm not doing okay I don't want my therapist to be disappointed, plus I don't know if I'm just being especially moody this week or if I actually need help.

I'm sorry if none of that really made any sense, I'm really stressed and tired right now and I didn't proofread this because if I do I'm worried I'll decide not to post it",mentalhealth,2021-01-21 20:57:57

I am aware that mental illness and mental health are two different things, because *illness* can literally mean the lack of some sort of composition of chemicals in you causing you to not be able to feel as much happiness as a 'normal' person (I didn't dive deep into it but I think that is the gist--if you would like to elaborate feel free). I'm not going to confirm that she has an illness, but *let's just say* she *does* get a diagnoses and it turns out to be a form of depression.

she is always most of the time in the 'dumps' and openly talks about not seeing a 'point in life' and 'why she bothers to even try anymore' on her private snap chat stories, and as a friend I find myself concerned and obligated to swipe up and imessage her to talk more about her day and to see if there's a root cause for her to say such drastic things---and over the course of our 5-6 year long friendship she always has a reason for saying such things, most (if not all) the time the 'off setter ' being some event or people that made her upset, whether it be her family or friends or how 'left out' she feels. 

I always ask her if she wants to talk about it ofc before I dive into the convo, and she most of the time says yes and I spend hours talking things through with her, giving her advice, listening, empathizing--overall just trying to be a good friend. it has gotten super repetitive with me looking out for her and almost to the point of being her therapist rather than friend, but I'm just trying to be there for her because I too in the past was in a dark place and it would've been nice to have someone by my side like I am for her

I don't think I mind much looking out for her, although recently it's starting to affect me more than I thought it should've

the thing I've wanted to talk about is how she's taken her anger and frustration and let it impact those around her. she scowls, makes the side eye, rolls her eyes a lot, victimizes herself in situations she puts herself into (ex: she'd say she always feels left out but leaves the room sometimes when we hang out expecting us to chase after her, or she *never* *initiates* to hang out with just me and feels offended when the other girl asks to hang out with just me--which only happened once ever bc of how upset she got), etc. we have a 3 person friend group, me being her most longest friendship compared to the other girl who she recently met a year ago, but it seems as if she's treating me way more harshly than the other girl- maybe it's taking advantage of the fact I was always there for her? or maybe because she's just used to me being kind and patient and dealing with her  attitude for the past years (sometimes I wonder why I held onto the friendship but again I just feel like I cant let go because of the state she's in). and worst of all when I confronted her she genuinely seemed like she wasn't aware of how it was affecting me so **she had no idea** of the consequences of her actions bc she was so stuck inside her own head. idk I just have been hurting whilst trying to keep her in check bc her hurting hurts me? Idek tbh

Ive been wondering that for people diagnosed with depression and anxiety, does it give more of a 'reasonable context' for your own negativity affecting those around you up to the point where it hurts others? I know it shouldn't be okay for anyone to get hurt at all but is your behavior towards others something that you are able to control? I know depression means a lot of negative thoughts but I dont know anything about it potentially hurting others

&amp;#x200B;

I had another friend in middle school who was diagnosed with crippling depression ADHD and anxiety *after* we drifted apart but *before* she did she'd spend a lot of time isolated and not being able to get out of bed, and neglecting to eat. id sometimes go over in the afternoon and she'd still be in bed and I'd have to wake her up and sometimes she didn't budge so I'd just chill in the living room bc I didn't know any better. but I don't think I've ever been treated as if I were a punching bag for all of the venting- I'd just feel neglected. 

these two situations are drastically different and ik everyone has their own way of communicating but I don't seem to know when to label one as toxic, or one as just 'someone with a mental illness that behavioral communication skills she can't control because it's an illness'

can you blame you behavior on a mental illness?

2 years ago I came into university loving finance, especially the stock market. I've been doing it since I was young, and to be honest I was pretty decent at investing. That is why I decided to major in honours finance. First year was ok, I did better than average in all my classes and was having an alright time is residence. I have a good group of university friends, and they were honestly the best part of my year. 

But ever since I started my second year, everything seemed to go downhill. I've applied to maybe 50 internships and I only got called in for an interview for 1. Didn't end up getting it. This really bummed me out, since all my friends were getting them without a problem. My marks also took a big hit since last year. Although I'm still doing better than the average, it is only 1 or 2 per cent. I'm also applying to businesses school this year, but in all honesty I don't think that's going to work out. With my low marks and my okay extra curriculars, it's a long shot at best. Now, I can't help but feel that I am a failure. Sure I'm doing alright in school, but in this industry I feel that if you aren't the best, you're nothing. 

As a result, it seems that I am completely numb to everything. Nothing excites me, nothing motivates me, nothing really makes me happy anymore. No matter what I do, I'm not interested in it. Whether it's classes, clubs, sports, I don't want to do anything. I just want to do nothing. The only reason I do any work is because I know other people in my program are doing work too, but it takes me maybe twice as long to do it. Even though I feel this, I put in so much time into what I do, yet I always never do well.   What doesn't help is that I always think I do well on these tests. I check over my work, and everything makes sense. Then I get my mark back and its a 73% when I thought I got a 90%. On every god damn thing. 

I always see other people doing fantastic. Great marks, junior analyst on the investment club, internships to pick and choose from, and I just can't help but feel that could have been me. I also don't know how to do half the shit these other kids in finance know how to. I see my friends loving what they do, and am envious that I don't love what I do anymore. I even changed my major to finance instead of honours, but to be honest thats not helping much. 

I've told my parents about this, and they're doing the best they can. But they are really busy with their work and can't really focus on me because they're starting their own companies. 

Now the only thing that makes me feel happy is imagining what life would be like if everything was what I thought it would be. Dreaming about having good marks, having a future, and overall loving what I do. 

Although I hide it well, I am in a really dark place. I tried talking to counselors, therapists, but nothings working. And to be honest, if business school doesn't work out, I might honestly kill myself. That might seem like an overreaction, but if I don't get in and I continue to not get internships, I know I won't be happy. I don't want to go through life constantly thinking I'm a failure. I just see no point living a life where I'm just not good enough. 

Now I know this sounds like first world problems, and I might be overreacting, but I just want all of this to end. I'm tired of always being anxious, sad, angry and all the other negative shit I've been feeling.

Please, if you've been in this situation and got out, please tell me how. Pushing through isn't working, thinking on the bright side isn't working, nothing really is. 

I just want this to end.",mentalhealth,2021-01-21 21:08:10

Hey guys. I'm not sure how many here are into the animation/gaming/streaming scene here but I figured I would just express some stuff here. Growing up with Autism and having an interest in art and special interests in things like anime, games, certain series (Pokemon, Yu-Gi-Oh, Beyblade, Klonoa, Sonic, etc), animation/cartoons, visual storytelling, etc. led to many challenges growing up in school, including constant bullying and feelings of nonexistent self-worth. It often felt like I was the kid everyone hated and some went out of their way to express that. It also wasn't easy being that kid and also going through trauma, and very difficult family life and abuse, including a divorce.

It was very difficult, but I did not let it stop me (otherwise I wouldn't be here saying this).

Around high school-ish time, I started doing something I had a passion for for a while, which was doing YouTube videos and streams, many about that topic matter. And as most content creators do, I evolved my content and made it the best I could all with a sense of style and high-energy humor combined with visual effects, especially in the videos and animations I made. 


Then after a while... like say, some years ago more trauma happened in my living circumstance. A lot of it gave me the worthless feelings all over again and caused me to not spend any time at all on content creating, and while it's been over for well over a year, I am still healing from it all. Also, a lot of my friendships at the time became toxic and in cause of it, I deleted my YouTube and Twitch and DeviantArt and Insta and other social medias despite the hundreds of subscribers and followers (which did stay stagnant/drop during my period of low creation). 

Last year near the end of last year, I really wanted to bring friends together and do a combination of a anime/gaming awards show I love doing combined with a art showcase of the creative endeavors my friends have created and put them for all to see in streaming. Of course though... the event did not go through as there was some serious drama in my friend group that was my audience and would not have been a good idea to create then despite how much I wanted to make some people (including myself) happy for 2020. 
It's especially not easy when after the fact I saw that people on YouTube and Twitch managed to create something that made a lot of people happy, things I always wanted to do as well such as review every season of Pokemon in-depth and with collaborators, or continue a story for an obscure game series through fancomic. These people also have millions of subscribers and they're my age or even younger, like 18 while I am 23. Absolutely nothing against those videos of course, they did great! Just I feel like there's no need for what I do and I am questioning if I am even talented at all or even make anyone happy. I just feel very depressed out of it and I feel very discouraged to do this stuff even now yet I still seriously want to. What should I do? Do I even have talent? Even when I did have subs I didn't have as many as, say Mark or Pewds. I don't even know how I should feel. I just feel empty. 


Any sort of words or advice or experience or anything would be appreciated.

Two of my courses are more workshop oriented, and I can pay attention in those (though I’m not doing amazing), but my other courses all blend together. I can’t bring myself to read the text books until well after I need to, can’t bring myself to start projects. I’m not even doing anything enjoyable in my down time. 

I don’t know what to do. I have standards for my grades, but I’m just going to let them slip away. I know I’ll regret doing that. I know that I’m being stupid. But I just don’t want to try anymore. 

I’ve been to councillors briefly before, but they’re always very goal-driven. Like: what’s your issue? Ah, can’t get that essay done on time? Well do XYZ.

I just don’t know what do. I don’t want to say I’m considering suicide, because that would be insensitive to people actually suffering, but the thought of just bashing my head in comes up and the first thing I think when I fail is “well, you should just kill yourself”. 

What do I do? There are all these balls in the air and they’re all going to come falling down.",mentalhealth,2021-01-21 21:55:49

There's some triggering stuff in here so please read at your own risk.

Recently I've become aware of my tendency to be impulsive. I act out sometimes without thinking about the consequences, and while it usually doesn't bother anyone much, last week I sent a video to a friend.
That video had violent, upsetting stuff in it; I won't go into details, but I sent it to her anyway because I was on a mental high. From what? I don't know. I wasn't happy to send it or anything, but I felt neutrally excited (if that even makes sense to feel excited without being happy, sad, angry or anything) and said as much before I posted it.
Obviously, she didn't take it well and I guess I didn't understand why she reacted so strongly until I posted on my status, ""scarred two people today, wooo""
She kinda went ballistic after that and called me f*cked up...
I guess I deserved it but at the same time... I don't need anyone to tell me I'm messed up. I know I am. I know I do things to upset people, but I dont know why I'm like this, or why I can't control my mood swings like normal people. Sometimes I'm on a high, and I get reckless and impulsive, and other times I'm just sad for a few hours or even days and think about things like how people would deal with having to find my body in a locked bathroom.

Sorry if I triggered anyone.

I don't know if I have a mental health issue or what, but last year I felt suicidal to the point of actually telling my parents (they're divorced btw) and then I got a therapist.  I felt silly talking about my problems to the person (really dumb, I know) because I didn't feel like that anymore. It's very frustrating. Every time I feel down I want to tell someone but when I actually try to do that it's as though my brain makes me happy so I end up not talking about it.

So anyway, since I sent that video and got the negative feedback, I've really been putting myself down a lot. I'm not giving myself room to breathe. I'm questioning everything I do, and trying to see if it measures up to ""normal"" standards or if it's ""f*cked up"" because the truth is, those words hurt a lot.

I don't like conflict so I wouldn't say it to her face, but I blocked her a few minutes ago, which led to me typing this. I just feel like bleh right now. Hopefully I can sleep it off.

Almost always sad, angry, irritable, what have you.

I got better (stopped drinking a ton, for one), and found myself more positive and happy most of the time. Granted, I started using cannabis more often, which has now turned to a daily thing.

But on nights when I don’t smoke (currently going 3 days without it, longest in a while), the negative thoughts are constantly there.

Yet, when the next day comes, I turn those thoughts completely around. 

For example, last night I had a minor mental breakdown. Cried for a bit. Doubted myself for a choice I’m making regarding my career. Really freaked out about all that.

Today? I talked to my dad after asking me about how this career change is going. I was extremely positive. Not fake positive. Like, I found myself feeling very happy afterward. I realized everything from the prior night was ridiculous. This happened multiple times today, regardless of if I had a conversation about it. My brain just flipped, and I felt dumb for being so crazy.

And...here we are. Again. It’s 11pm. And my mind is racing, about the exact same things. All negative. Despite literally today telling myself there’s not reason to do this!

This happens quite often. I know that the night is prone to anxiety, but the difference is I’m thinking about the exact same things during the day, but with just entirely different emotions.

I always told myself I was a night owl; in reality, I think it’s because I’m kept up by negative thoughts for no reason. I had a great day today — I even have COVID right now and still stayed productive! Talked to my parents, a few of my friends, watched a hockey game with my roommate (also has COVID), applied to graduate schools, etc. etc.

Yet, I’m stuck awake rethinking all of it, and dreading what’s going to happen tomorrow—even though, most likely, nothing will happen tomorrow.

I have plenty of other mental issues right now, and have been struggling with my recently graduated, newly adult self, but this is something I feel if I could fix, would help me greatly.

Ugh, I don't even know where to begin to be honest. Hey, I'm a 17 year old suicidal high schooler who is currently failing all of his classes despite the fact the new semester has just begun. I would go into full detail about how I got here but depressingly there is so much stuff that I would need to go into and it is mentally draining and not really making me better but that's why I'm writing this, because I wanna not feel alone... I wanna be better.

Um, growing up I was told that the Bible was the book of God and that God is righteous in everything he says and does. Growing up, I was told I wasn't a good person and that my mother was worried about me because I would lie to get out of trouble. Usually small lies, but lies nonetheless. Example, when I was like 10 or 11 I typed ""Boobies"" into the search bar and my mom asked me if I had done it and I swore to her I didn't. So, she would say to me that she was worried I would turn into my older half brother.

Who was my older half brother? Well, when he was in high school he caught a guy looking at his girlfriend and so my brother then slammed the guys head into the crease of the stair case. Let's just say he had a lot of trouble with the law and he was in and out of psych wards pretty often. I actually haven't talked to him in I think 7 years now. Anyways my mom would compare me to him a lot and one day when I was 11ish I told myself I was gonna become a better person. The only way I knew how was to become more religious. The more religious the more right you are with God after all. I read the Bible everyday and prayed twice a day and tried to find pastors to listen to on YouTube.

I didn't find the ""right"" pastor until I was 13, Steven L. Anderson of Faithful Word Baptist Church. I became a huge fan of pastor Anderson and would watch 3 of his sermons everyday one in the morning, one during school and one after school. I'm gonna leave a few details out because it's too embarrassing and not as important anyways but lets just say I was class president and I had a teacher who was very religious and during our class meetings I would ""preach"" my views onto my classmates and eventually one of my classmates went to the principle and got him to stop it. He demanded my teacher prevent me from going off on my religious tangents but she refused and actually quit because of it.

Anyways, long story short I wanted to do the greatest thing any Christian could ever do for God which was (at least in my view) prove atheists wrong. After listening to a bunch of atheists and looking into atheist arguments I started to doubt my own religious faith and views. I went to a few different pastors and asked them questions and a common thing I would hear was ""I'm not sure, but I know that as long as your hearts good with God and you put this into his hands you'll find an answer eventually"" or something like that. So after a year of mental torture I became an atheist. I was a bisexual but it took me an entire extra year after being an atheist to finally accept that as well.

But, now the problem is if my family finds out I'm fucked because they're really conservative. My older sister is agnostic but even she isn't open about that. Oh, I almost forgot... When I was a religious extremist I very much fell into the alt right pipeline and was an actual Nazi to put it bluntly. Anyways after my faith fell eventually I started listening to more liberal and left leaning political commentators and naturally lean more left leaning now.

Anyways, I'm a closeted atheist, leftie, bisexual in a very conservative town and family. It was already hard to make friends now it's almost impossible. Ugh, I feel like this post is too long. l have so much I still haven't mentioned though so I guess I'll try to sum up my life. My father disowned me when I was 5, my grandparents recently disowned me and banned me from their house because I said that if you don't wanna say the Pledge of Allegiance you shouldn't have to and that I don't do it because it feels pretty Orwellian.

I have no friends and I can't talk to my family about my problems because I'm a bisexual and if they found out they'd kick me out of the house and I know this because of the many ""LGBT people are creepy and gross"" comments they make which is a lot. One of the only childhood memories I have is a memory of my half brother holding a knife while staring at me through the doorway in the middle of the night just standing there. My twin died in childbirth and though it shouldn't effect me I feel like had my twin not died I wouldn't be alone like I am.

And the only relationship I have ever been in ended in me trying to commit suicide because she cheated on me and I broke up with her and then she went to school the next day and lied about me and said I broke up with her because her brother vaped and that I ""didn't let her have friends"" which was a blatant like because the only friends of hers I didn't like was the dude who she cheated on me with and a few of her lesbian friends who kept hitting on her and would even kiss her and discuss having sex with her. Anyways, even though that was a year ago people still remember me as either the guy who tried to commit suicide because of my relationship problems or remembers me as some abusive piece of shit and a horrible person for breaking up with my ex. I had put her in as one of the reasons for my suicide in my suicide note. I posted the note on my snap story and then my mother found out and took me to the psych ward. After a few days they let me out and the first text I get was from her mom saying she was gonna sue me for slander because as I had just said, I put her as the main reason for my suicide in my note.

I have had things thrown at me during lunch and have had water poured on me as I was walking down the stairwell because of my breakup. I am trying to move on past it but anytime I try to ask someone I'm interested in for their snap or number I just physically can't do it. I guess I'm just not ready or something.

Funny enough there's so much more I could say but I'm mentally exhausted and I just wanna say fuck it and lay down and drown in my own misery and self pity. The chances someone reads this are already not very good so I've essentially typed this whole essay out for no reason. If you have any questions though or are interested in hearing me bitch more about my life by all means comment, or message me or whatever. I don't care, I just wanna not feel alone anymore. I could've written this post better but I can't think straight right now",mentalhealth,2021-01-21 23:49:14

It is known to begin and end at the same times each year. Most people with SAD experience lower levels of mood and energy during the fall and winter months, but SAD can also occur during spring and early summer. 

People experiencing SAD may believe that these feelings are fleeting and will pass with time, however promoting that mindset will only lead to internalizing negative feelings on your own, potentially adding on to the symptoms already present. As such, it is good to acknowledge the possible symptoms to prepare for the oncoming days ahead during those months. Here are some examples of symptoms and signs to watch out for. 

· Feelings of depression throughout the day

· Low energy

· Lost of interest in activities you once enjoyed

· Changes in weight or appetite

· Difficulty in concentrating

· Thoughts about death or suicide

People have called me weird, made fun of me, and I was not socially accepted. The repercussions of this on my academics were bad and my grades started to dip. This heavily impacted me as I used to have low-self esteem, which I did not realise until much later. Needless to say, I've also had to deal with the terrible emotional effects of loneliness. Having gone through severe depression and a lot of pain, these are \_\_ ways through which the lockdown helped me raise my self-esteem, be comfortable with myself and gain confidence:

1. **Accepting my loneliness** \- I always liked to think that I had friends and that I was a popular kid when I neither had the former nor was the latter. I was living in denial and this blocked any positive changes from occurring. Coming to terms with my loneliness was difficult as I had to come to terms with the worst possible outcome that I would face, which was being lonely for my entire life. Eventually, as I developed the courage to do so, this thought enabled me to take better care of myself, put myself before others and most importantly, be more independent.
2. **Being in my own skin** \- As a result of spending a lot of time alone, I learnt to control my mind effectively using the following methods :  

   1. **Changing perspective and thinking of my body as a shield that protects me from things that make me uncomfortable -** When it's cold outside, people often cover themselves with blankets to feel warm. Similarly, I trained my mind to think of my body as a blanket that covers my personality, which is concealed on the inside. This took a lot of time to develop, but I find it extremely helpful in keeping me calm and allowing me to think rationally when I get nervous or uncomfortable.
   2. **Realising that other people around me don't shape the way I feel about myself -** I was always afraid of being judged wrongly by people and used to overthink about situations in the past a lot. Realising that other people don't shape the way I feel, that most of them are not going to be alongside me throughout my life and that I will, on the other hand, be alongside myself by living my life helped me prioritise my own feelings and made my overthinking endeavours non-existent. Again, this took me a considerable amount of time to develop and throughly believe in.
3. **By turning a blind eye to everyone else present around me and focusing only on the person that I have a conversation with** \- This helped me single out conversations and in turn, be able to carry conversations effectively and for a long time. This, surprisingly, helped me get rid of my social anxiety and allowed me to meet more people and make more friends.
4. **By acknowledging the worst possible outcome of my actions and accepting the consequences of it** \- This helped me boost my self-esteem, be calmer and helped me do things better as I made my mind believe that I had nothing to lose.
5. **By focusing on the words spoken and not the looks of a person or the way they speak** \- Helped me gain confidence.
6. **By dealing with things using logic and less emotions**
7. **Reflecting the same energy or lower that I received while speaking with a person**
8. **Realising that others are their own individuals and not tied to me in any way** \- Helped me deal with overthinking and gain confidence.
9. **Constantly referring to the 8 ways mentioned above to ensure that I ingrain them in my daily life.**

To reiterate, the 9 ways mentioned above helped me deal with social anxiety, depression, loneliness, overthinking and self-esteem issues. My sole intent to share this here is to reach out to people undergoing one or more of the aforementioned issues that may find these methods beneficial.",mentalhealth,2021-01-22 00:26:19

I don't think she cares about my problems as much as I do about hers and that's completely understandable, she probably thought it was something silly to be mad about or something like that.

She is the only person that doesn't think I'm a fucking freak and i just don't want her to leave me.   


Everyone around me thinks I'm a freak and a weirdo, and I probably am because I just can't describe what horrible things I would do to those people, I just want to SQUEEZE the life out of them in ways I can't describe.   


Maybe I just don't deserve to be loved, maybe those people are right.

i'm currently 13 (almost 14) i have 2 older sisters, a mom, and a dad.

when covid first started, my oldest sister came back abit earlier and couldn't go back to china when she heard the news. (i'm gonna call her A and my other sister B) i really disliked A, she's 8 years older than me but she's way more spoiled and arrogant.
A would always come to my room and bother me by sometimes sitting on me, making fun of me, always goes in my room and leaves me no space then complain to my parents about me locking the door or accidentally punching or kicking her in self defense.
she would also often say anything possible in front of family and friends about me to make me look bad and brag about herself to everyone.

i know these are just normal sibling traits and i could handle it but more and more she started getting more forceful and bratty and comparing me alot, basically lowering my self confidence. she started also getting more physical. when i talked to my parents about it, they said they'd help but they didn't even do much other than tell her to not do it and sometimes would just watch her do these things to me. 

i started locking myself in more and more.
my dad started to get mad at me and would bang the door and slam stuff and say that i just made excuses about my sister and would threaten to throw a plate of food at me if i didn't eat, my mom would even encourage my dad and scold me about it but no one cares enough to talk to A about it because she was the first and most loved child and how she always lowered me because i was the 'spoiled youngest'.
B didn't even care about it tbh, even would sometimes start topics about me and then A would tag along then B would say that she had nothing else involved with it.

my family started blaming my phone because they saw me constantly using it and that i got addicted but my phone was honestly the only place where i could talk to other people about it.

when my parents took my room locks and keys away, i broke. i started to self-harm myself, stay up late and not eat for god knows how long. i just wanted it to end. i have gotten slightly better since then because of online friends but it's so annoying that everyone just picks sides and trusts my sister more. no one even cares to ask about how I felt.

even when they start being more nicer now they always change back to their normal ways and it's so fake, i think of running away sometimes yk?",mentalhealth,2021-01-22 00:36:06

I had a rough childhood. I was emotionally abused severely on a daily basis by my father and other close relatives (lived in very rural area only family members nearby). I have always had issues with anxiety and panic attacks. I can recall numerous times as a child where I would absolutely be devastated because I believed a family member had died in a horrific accident. This would occur at any moment. I am diagnosed with C-PTSD as a result of the traumatic childhood I experienced. There were 3 occasions that I reported to my mother about some of the sexual abuse I was experiencing and nothing happened. I would make it overtly clear to teachers and friends at school that I was suicidal and depressed and no one seemed to be bothered or concerned.

I've been in therapy for 2 years now but I can't get away from these feelings. I've begged her to stop buying this food so that we can all have a happy healthy life but she refuses to hear me.

There are times when my experiences seem like the stereotypical acid trip.  I see shapes and bright vivid colors sometimes, but other times, things always appear to be moving.  I'll also randomly see animals, specifically bunnies and frogs, that never actually exist.

This is especially prevalent when I am walking or even driving.  All of a sudden the ground below me will appear to crawl.  I have on many instances been driving down a main road when a car on a side road appears to continuously move toward me, causing me to want to veer to the side of the road to avoid being hit.  During these instances when someone is with me, they will always ask what I am doing, because the other cars are still at the stop sign.  

Most of the time, I am with it enough to wonder why the hell a bunny would be in my room, and snap back with it.  Or I can convince myself that everything is stationary and not bothering me.  

Does anyone else have these experiences?  Is there any other way to describe it than that I am just straight up delusional?",mentalhealth,2021-01-22 01:23:31

It's still something people ask me questions about. I've been thinking about this for a while, and i've finally decided that my thoughts might be able to help someone. So, here goes:

1) Imagine the worst day you've ever had. Don't lie, we all have bad days. The important thing to remember here is that we all respond to things differently. Everyone thinks of ""The World"" as a single place, when in reality there are how many people living on Earth? THAT'S how many worlds there are. What I view as traumatic will differ from your view- and that's ok. So just imagine the worst day YOU have ever had. 

2) Now imagine that something you see/hear/smell/taste/feel not only reminds you of this day, but it causes you to relive it. And by relive, I mean experience the same emotional and physical responses that you initially had during that day. 

3) Imagine that every.single.day something makes you relive the bad day. So you start to avoid people/places/things, trying to keep yourself from re-experiencing this bad day. You avoid your loved ones, maybe you don't go to a whole city or town, maybe the color red is what you start to avoid. We never know what a trigger will be until it happens.

4) You become hyper-vigilant, you become angry and depressed, maybe you begin to self-medicate. You try to pretend you're ok, because if you aren't ok then you have to actually face the bad day- what happened to you. But facing it means you can't breathe, your palms become sweaty, you lose sleep.... So you try to hide it, in vain. 

5) You wake up the next day, and do it all over again. 

This is what PTSD is. If you also have been diagnosed, I am so sorry and I wish you didn't have to experience it. If you do not have PTSD, this is what it is like. 
Everyone always wants to know what happened, as if it mattered. It's irrelevant. People like to compare, even if they don't mean to. I had someone tell me once that they felt like they didn't belong in the group therapy with me because ""their problem wasn't as bad."" It doesn't matter WHY anyone has PTSD- or anything else for that matter. What matters is that you aren't alone, there is effective treatment, and things absolutely can get better. 

End rant by saying that I am not licenced, I do not have a degree yet, but I know what it is like to go through therapy, be in school for counseling, and work in behavioral health. If you need someone to talk to, I will try my best to respond to every comment.",mentalhealth,2021-01-22 01:23:32

You probably know me by now. I crave attention while also hating it. I ask for help even though I don't want to. I'm dying, even though I don't really want to. I want to enjoy things. I want to spend time with things that matter. Yet here I am anyway.
Overall, I'm a hypocritical misfit, though I've never really been one to give a shit about my own hypocrisy. Instead, all my fears reside in others; I worry no one else can accept my nature.
I'm an incredibly selfish person. I feel entitled to whatever I want, and I want it only in the most perfect way. Let's take relationships, for instance: I want to be with someone that is entirely mine, completely green to love. I want to be the only one to lead them through it. And the thought of anyone having that meaningful connection to someone else immediately disturbs me. Then I can't help but be stuck on relationships that passed with that opportunity, and I end up craving something I was never entitled to in the first place. 
Or in a career: I want to be the sole force that keeps a business operating. I want to be the center of it all, to the point that excluding me is harmful. I operate on the assumption that I keep the machine running, and everyone would regret should I not participate, even if I don't fit well. Rather, everything should change to suit me instead. I know best, after all.
The same applies to academics; I know what's best for me. I know exactly when something is unreasonable. Some bad grades are undoubtedly bad for a reason, but others are not. Those are a result of unfair prejudice against my existence. The circumstances of my humanity pit others against me when my choices are entirely valid.
And all of these combine together to form a belief of defectiveness. Because why should I feel this way? Surely it can't be normal. But nothing shakes it, so maybe it is normal? And then I'm merely unhappy because nothing goes exactly my way. 
So you can see where there's some issues. They only continue from there, going more in-depth with plenty of examples. The 14-year-old, the ex, the current, the old friend, the professor, the colleagues, the senior, the ungrateful, the friends, the self. 
All hidden in one fictional, dusty tome, waiting to be read but never truly exposed. 
If someone can find all the pages and hold them tight, I might finally be free.

Ever since I was a little kid I would have violent sexual fantasies. For example, I would fantasize about Hannah Montana killing her brother Jackson, and these fantasies would always have sexual themes. Like they wouldn't be directly sexual because I didn't really know about sex yet, but in the scenarios Hannah Montana would always be dominant in a way that seemed like she got sexual gratification from it. I would fall asleep thinking about these things almost every night.

It wasn't just that though. If I saw a little boy, I would think about hurting him. I was 4-5 at the time, so little boys ages 1-3 were the kind I thought about hurting. As I got older these fantasies stopped and for awhile I didn't really have any sexual thoughts, but that all changed when I started going through puberty. I started thinking about sex all the time, which is normal because I was at that age. And I began masturbating all the time. I started to have fantasies about being dominated myself and being sexually tortured. I now know that I'm a masochist.

But I am attracted to young boys. I know that this is wrong and a mental illness, and I plan on never acting on my attractions. My sexual fantasies towards young boys are no longer violent, I'd say they're ""normal"" (as in I just think about dating them and having sex with them like you would a boyfriend). I like boys ages 9-12, 11 being my ideal age. I don't know why I have these thoughts. I think that I like the innocence little boys who haven't reached puberty have, as sick as that sounds. I am still mainly attracted to guys my own age, and I prefer guys my own age, I just think about young boys when I see them.

Today at work this man told his son to stay by the register while he tried on some pants, so me and his son started talking and he was probably about 10, and I was attracted to him. So much so that after they checked out I followed him upstairs with his family and I followed him around. When we were going up the escalator he turned around and waved at me and this made me so happy.

I know right from wrong and I know that following this child around the store was wrong and I shouldn't have done that. I wish I could just stop thinking about young prepubescent boys but I can't.

I would go see a therapist and tell them about these fantasies but I'm scared they would make me go to some hospital and tell my family, and I also have a mother that is very emotionally abusive and would dismiss the idea of me going to therapy like she has in the past.

I don't think I'm in danger of offending or anything, I would just really like some insight on this situation and maybe get some advice. Thanks and any feedback is appreciated!",mentalhealth,2021-01-22 02:56:54

For example, today, I had my first panic attack since a couple years ago due to said family issues. Due to this, my productivity has also been in an all-time low. I yearn to be back on my computer working through the stuff I have waiting for me to return to, but I also recognize that I can't just neglect my mental health. However, this creates a vicious cycle for me, where I simultaneously want to be productive so I can be happier but can't due to my current mental health.

I struggled with self harm most of my life. It started when I was 11, after my sibling’s father abandoned us for a bus ticket to New York. He not only pawned off my deceased grandmothers jewelry that was left for us(who I watched die when I was 4), but also lied about having cancer, made us cry over his fictional death, lied about a million dollar lawsuit that would FINALLY grant my brother and I our own bedrooms. Yay! No more sharing bunk beds and living with the ants and dilapidated flooring! He promised us a real home. We spent much of my youth homeless or living from a hotel or couches. One time my uncle took us in, only to throw us to the streets and keep all our toys and books for school.

I loved school. I loved reading. I missed a lot of school growing up, I lost my books that day, I lost my backpack that day, I lost everything and didn’t understand because I was a prepubescent little girl in a grown man’s world and this grown man took all my stuff from me.

My life changed immensely after that day. I grew up hearing the muck from my mother. “I should’ve never had you guys, I should’ve thrown you in foster care, I wish your dad took you when he left.” 

I didn’t understand a lot. So I self harmed and self harmed and today I am one year clean from a 13 year addiction to my knife. I am a childhood sexual abuse survivor, I’m an adult rape survivor, I’m an adult survivor of childhood homelessness, I am a two time suicide survivor. I am clean off hard drugs and alcohol. And I want to live. I want to love. I want to be here now because I have found purpose in being alive. 

I see it when I get to kiss my dog hello after a long (or very short) departure. I see it when my family celebrates my victories and when they mourn my downfalls with me. I see it in my new found soul family. However, I can’t seem to shake the feeling that I’m too messed up for anyone. That I always will be. 

I have a boyfriend now, but it’s hard sometimes. It’s hard sometimes to live this “normal”, sane, beautiful life. I never felt like I deserved to be where I am today, but I’m here. I’m crying as I write this. I know it’s a long read and I doubt anyone will comment or even take the time to listen, but if you did, thank you.",mentalhealth,2021-01-22 03:55:25

Apologies first of all if this is not the optimum sub for this. Please advice if I should've posted somewhere else. 

I think the best way for me to approach this is to just dump out my purse and see what everyone else thinks. I don’t know if this background info below is useful, but I’ll provide it just to give a fuller picture. I’ve no idea what’s relevant.

I’ve been on SSRIs for about six years following my marriage breakdown. I tried coming off them but I felt pretty lousy so I stuck with it. That’s been fine with me. It doesn’t bother me for the most part, and having been an anxious young adult and had (what I’ve retroactively come to understand was childhood trauma due to family issues), it’s helped me feel a little less “on the edge” about some things. 

Within the last two years I’ve been dealing with the sudden death of one parent (whom I had long term issues with), and the now impending demise of the other due to multiple long-term illnesses, which is happening on the other side of the planet from me. I have one younger sibling whom prior to these things I was never particularly close with, for good or bad reasons - just doing our own thing - but now I speak to on a daily basis via text and occasionally video (due to time differences it’s not always easy to co-ordinate). 

I feel pretty guilty most of the time for being so far away and unable to help my sibling who has been the primary care-giver for my remaining parent, while dealing with their own greif, while at the same time kinda secretly glad I’m here, and not having to deal with all that stuff constantly. One feeling sort of feeds the other and around they go making me feel terrified of it all, guilty as hell, an worried about my sibling's future.

My partner has suggested several times that I should speak to someone about these things - and that’s where I’m having the issues. I’ve spoken to three different councillors in the last five years. The first right after the marriage ending, telling me that I seemed to be doing all the right things for my mental health - talking to trusted friends, being logical about things, having the ability to think out my problems as I talked etc - so said to just keep that up, and only come back if I really needed to. I didn’t feel I needed to. 

I saw a second person at the beginning of 2020, mainly to focus on the parental death, and while some of what that person suggested was helpful, for the most part they did the majority of the talking, and I didn’t really feel like I got the chance to talk at length about the things related to my parent I was feeling. That councillor also forgot the my parent was dead in one session, and asked me “what our relationship was like now” - which was pretty much the end of those sessions.

Around 3-4 months ago, I went to see another councillor - but again, the session felt like it was talking about how to manage stress and do mindfulness techniques, and I barely did any speaking. I understand you don’t just walk into a room with a total stranger and begin monologuing, but at the same time - I could tell the thrust of this person’s approach wasn’t going to be for me. 

In subsequent chats with other friends who’ve tried to do the same thing as me re: therapy/counselling, they’ve reported similar issues, and I guess I just want some input on what I might be doing wrong.

The main points for me is that I feel as though I don’t have a good answer for why I’m there. “my partner suggested it” doesn’t really seem enough. I feel flat and empty inside a lot of the time, and  disgusted with my appearance and often sleepy and like there’s no point in anything, but I’ve always felt like that to differing degrees - I find those questions for depression/stress/anxiety quite hard to answer because philosophically, of course life is meaningless - so yes, i do often think that - but it’s not stopping me getting out of bed and going to work every day either, y’know? the whole line of questioning seems bogus.

I’ve found myself preoccupied with the idea that i’m not doing the sessions “right”, which I understand isn’t how that works - but knowing that doesn’t stop me from worrying to myself that i’m not saying the “right things” and that’s why the sessions aren’t going the way i expect them to.

And similarly, I feel less interested in their “solutions” and feel more like what I need is someone to just listen while I blather on for a bit. But I don’t know if that’s what these people do, or if that would be helpful, but it’s what I want to do. And no, I guess it’s not the kind of thing I can do with mates, or my partner - again, I don’t know if it “should” be, but it isn’t for me. Talking about childhood, worries, big questions, irrational/invasive thought patterns - the stuff that I’m dealing with day to day without being drowned out by them, having someone pick through what i’m describing and going “oh, that could be x” or “how did y make you feel?” or whatever is more what i’ve been imagining. It’s not that I don’t want their help, but I guess it’s felt so far with the people i’ve seen that it’s a little like they want to skip the specifics and get to the “do this, try that” stuff and not have to sit through my specifics. I have no idea why it annoys me, but the concern about not feeling heard again makes the idea of trying to go back to see someone again so off-putting. 

Is any of this making sense or relatable to anyone out there? It’s doing my head in.",mentalhealth,2021-01-22 04:08:44

I couldn't continue medication and counseling due to an unsupportive mother and insufficient funds. Although I am generally a positive person my trauma and my depression hinders me from making connections.

I love people and I love being intimate. I want more friends, but I am afraid to open up because I can't even handle myself. Why would I expect others to be able to handle me? So I don't open up and I am bubbly and energetic and kind but sometimes I get really down and I have to run back to isolation so I can deal with it by myself and I push my friends away and it never lasts long because I can't keep myself happy. I love bomb anyone who's willing to accept my love and then I push them away when I am upset.

I found that when I get into relationships, It's the opposite. I still love bomb them (not a good thing) and I am anxiously attached and subconsciously expect them to know how to cheer me up. Nobody can handle me, but somehow I expect my partners to, even if my conscious mind tells me not to. When they can't handle me, I cry and tear myself down and they end up watching me spiral. My former best friend, whom really liked me and I really liked, ended up spiraling down with me and they had to go to therapy after. They cut me off. I'm not mad. I'm sorry. 

I am trying to find value in myself and I am working hard towards my goals, but I already hate myself a lot and I don't think life is very fun to participate in so I need friends but I can't keep them because of how I am. How do I fix myself? What do I do?",mentalhealth,2021-01-22 04:12:39

I recently stumbled on borderline personality disorder and I think it sounds like something I identify with. I really want to go to a therapist to see if they agree. My most recent therapist has been one of my better experiences in therapy but I ended up quitting with her for several reasons a few months ago. 

First of all, I feel as though the problems I’m experiencing are very significant and abnormal. I would vent to my therapist and she would continually tell me “Oh! This problem is completely normal!” Which would absolutely frustrate me because I felt like she was either lying to me about it being normal to improve my self esteem, or she misunderstood me. It really degraded my trust about her honesty and ability to understand me. I really feel like her focus was on improving my self-esteem rather than helping me work through the real problems that are wrecking havoc in my life. I would tell her absurd things I did and she would reassure me they were okay. And I just feel like I need a therapist who is going to ground me in reality.

Second of all, I felt like the sessions lacked structure and like we lacked clear goals. I often needed to vent to my therapist, so I was okay with using sessions for that. But sometimes I was feeling okay and didn’t have a lot to vent about and I felt like those sessions were wasted. I’d really like her to have a plan for those days where I’m not freaking out.

I actually would really prefer to get another therapist, but I’ve looked online and I’m just not finding anyone who I really feel would be a good fit and is within a reasonable distance. On one hand, I feel like I wanna return to my old therapist, but on the other I don’t because I don’t know that these issues would resolve even if I tell her about them. And I also don’t know if I’m ever going to rebuild that trust even if she does fix things on her end. I tend to not give people a chance fix their mistakes though. I also have a very bad habit of switching/discarding people in my life from friends to doctors to coffee shop cashiers (I’ll just go to another location once they start recognizing me). 

One of my biggest fears is that I’m going to go there and talk about BPD and she’s going to tell me there’s nothing wrong with me because she either doesn’t understand me or doesn’t want me to worry. Quite frankly even if she did diagnose me with BPD, I wouldn’t even believe in that either because I’d assume I just used my persuasive skills to manipulate her (or any other therapist for that matter). So I’m not really sure what the point of going to a therapist for a diagnosis is anyways. I don’t even know why I want a diagnosis so bad in the first place. BPD has a terrible stigma. It’s like how at work I push so hard to get certain tasks and then I get them and I hate them.

So I’m just spinning my wheels eternally because I can’t make a decision on what to do. I feel like a need a therapist to help me find a therapist. Any thoughts/perspective would be much appreciated.",mentalhealth,2021-01-22 04:26:17

I don't regret any of it, I loved most of my upbringing. However around my teenager years I notice signs of Asperger's/ADHD (I'm mostly convinced I have some form of autism, but I don't know)

I currently live out of home, but in the past couple of years I have noticed that I am affection starved. I have 1 close friend that actually says she loves me and occasionally gives me a hug, but apart from that, I barely see the rest of my friends (we talk a lot online, sometimes play some games, but I don't feel like I am loved).

My question is: Knowing that I probably am on the autism scale, how do I approach people to form loving connections (I'm not looking for anything sexual btw). I've realised that people won't approach me, and quite frequently I'm in a group of work colleagues, and they will kinda move so that I am pushed out of the circle.

Two days ago I had a phone call with my psychiatrist, she increased my meds again and gave me a few recommendations. Among them, she suggested I see a friend IRL. I don't have any friends in the city where I study, only an acquaintance from my marine biology courses.

Just after hanging up with my psychiatrist, I sent this acquaintance a weird message, proposing her to come over. I'm not really sure why but she accepted, and even seemed happy!

So yesterday, even if I didn't really feel like it, I cleaned my whole appartment, put on nice clothes, and I even went grocery shopping (I usually hate that, it drains too much of the few energy I have lol).

She came on the afternoon. We made some snacks together, and ate them watching a movie. I had feared a lot it would be awkward because we don't know each other a lot, but it was really fun!

I was super exhausted after that (and went directly to sleep at 6pm, oops), but also super glad I did it!

And in bonus, I had some snacks leftovers I ate for diner (when I woke up at 11pm, but still), and a clean appartment!

im starting to see actual visual hallucinations without any drugs of any sort. i have smoked a little pot many years ago, but literally nothing since. no tobacco or vapes. barely any alcohol. odd night maybe 3 times a year ill actually get drunk. i have been on amphetamines such as ritalin and vyvanse for most of my life, but last month i stopped the vyvanse cold turkey and have seen improvements. i had to stop ritalin because i realised i was beginning to desire it for abuse and not health.

i was on respirdone (sp?) since grade 5 (now age 27), but stopped that cold turkey last fall. it was a very weak suicide attempt after i had literally given up. my best friend had left me, i was being threatened to be kicked out by my parents, other friends (2/2) were afraid to talk with me cuz i either burdened them or yelled at them, a few years ago my closest friend ever ditched me...

ive been put on prozac for several years. i was prescribed epival... sometime.. i think last winter? i swear my medication literally does nothing for me. ive always been noted by drs even from a very young age that im extremely self aware. i can literally feel when a medication is working and when its not. so far, epival only lasted a few days after an increase then i was 'normal'. 

the hallucinations are usually of tendrils or spider legs coming off things that shouldnt have them, such as game controllers or furniture. they seem to flail around as if alive or blown by a wind. the coffee table the other night had ""dust streams"" coming from it that were the same colour as the wood. it was as if it was being slowly blown away by an invisible wind. i wonder if its an extra sense. or maybe im just tired. or crazy.

there have been weird things happening for several years. one day, i woke up and had a VERY thick foreign accent. i cant even describe it. almost irish plus scottish plus japanese and a few others. either way: not me. if i forced my normal accent it was extremely stuttered and i made many mistakes. i called my pharmacist, drs office, and then 911 and all 3 agreed that i was showing stroke like symptoms. (they made me do some quick tests like raising arms and something with the tongue. i failed them all). get in the ambulance, they agree im showing those symptoms. im crying cuz i dont want this to happen. get to the hospital. they put me in triage and give me a number and walk away. my mom shows up (she had left work) and is floored by both my condition and treatment. i lose consciousness in the waiting area and hit my head on the wall. it wakes me up. 15 minutes later im 100% normal. see the doctor: the emts put me as 100% healthy. dr didnt believe i heard them say otherwise. so i just stormed out.

and now im speaking in tongues randomly. ill start speaking absolute nonsense VERY fast and it is very complex tongue movements, yet i never bite my tongue. normally, i cant get through a paragraph without at least one bite. 

ive been told by a friend i may have a parasite. i was convinced i had worms at one point. i swear there was blood in my stool but now there isnt. a couple days when i went to the washroom, a torrent of fresh blood was released from the rear exit. the hospital didnt care however. they wanted to put me in the mental ward cuz i said that i was depressed by accident. so, i got verbally violent with them and they left for security, i got dressed, and ran out. crashed through a closed sliding door and got cut up on the pavement. no way im going to their stupid ward. not again.

ive had 2 other suicide attempts in the past. both failed supremely. ive been with a psychiatrist for 5 or 6 years. autism, adhd, aspergers, general paraphilia, intrusive thoughts, OCD, bipolar... probably more... i cant keep track. i at one point read the test for various personality disorders and i was possibly positive for at least a dozen of them. but my dr refused to even try testing. saying they were attributable to autism.

I was wrong.,"Tw ED. Maybe don't read if you can relate too much. 

I've had eating problems since I was 15. I used to go entire weeks without eating a thing, and I'm afraid I'm oh my course to doing so. 

I have shitty a metabolism, my entire family does, and for the longest time the only diet I found that worked was no diet. 

But, my mind doesn't let me just stay at a goal I reach. 

Anorexics will typically set a goal weight, my original one way back when I was 15 was 112, I wound up at 90 pounds. 

It always happens, whenever I recovered and then relapsed it was because I reached a weight I didn't like, wanted to lose a few pounds, stopped eating, kept going, and now I'm back to nearly dying. 

I FINALLY thought I'd found an out with the keto diet. An actual healthy diet than I can attest genuinely works. I felt like i finally had control over my eating, I was at a reasonable weight and I got to eat food I enjoyed without gaining much. 

But, I guess old habits never die, because after several months of eating healthily, my mind has decided yet again that its not enough. 

I want to go back to being underweight, I want to feel hunger pains, I want to see my ribs and be too fucking thin. 

I don't know why I want this, it makes no sense, but I do, and I hate that I do.

I'm tired of recovery, I'm tired of trying, I'm tired of relapsing, I'm tired of it all. 

I thought it was over, it WAS over for like half a fucking year, longer than it had been since I was 15, but now it's back. 

I joined with a Pro-Ana group again so I can be surrounded by people who will encourage my horrible habits. Because I'm stupid and pathetic and deserve it. 

And because I'm just fucking tired of trying to recover, I'm sick of the in-between, I'm sick of everything. 

I dont know what to do, I wish I wasn't like this, I hate my mind, I hate that it won't let me be healthy, I hate that this is only one of a gigantic list of problems. I hate i hate it I hate it.",mentalhealth,2021-01-22 05:31:35

I want to see her more often, like every week. But I’m not the one paying my appointments, my parents do. 

In my country luckily therapy it’s not as expensive, it’s around 50 per appointment, my family can afford it, but still it’s money, basically 1200 a year, which is a lot. And I feel guilty for using so much of my parents money. Especially because I have a very hard time opening up and facing my problems so I know it will be a long journey and more money. 

My parents are supportive, i mean they pay for every appointment. But sometimes the kinda complain. 

I remember one time my father was trying to make me talk, and i refused and he said in a very disappointed tone something along the lines of “oh you’re going to make me spend other money on therapy?” Like he expected that I was already fixed and ready to talk openly with him (i should mention that as a family we never talk about our feelings, we are supportive but just keep things to ourselves, so this attempt felt forced and weird).

Every time I want to ask my therapist for a sooner appointment i think about this episodes and other similars, so I don’t ask her, and I post pone every thing ever further. 

I was also thinking about not going ti therapy at all because the idea that after all this years (i used to go to therapy also a few years ago but very rarely, like once every few months) i am still in this very dark place makes me think that I’m just wasting my parents money.

I know that alot of people have been struggling because of corona and the current state of the world, and alot of people have it way worse than I have, but I was hoping I could find some advice or just a ear/eyes that listen/read this. I also excuse for my English as it is not my native language. 

I have always been quite a ""happy go lucky"" kind of person with alot of empathy for other people. One of the main reasons for that is that I have gone through therapy because of abuse in my childhood which lead to social anxiety and depression. I finished therapy a few years ago and lived happily and ""mental problem"" free for a while, until recently. 

The beginning of covid wasn't too hard. There was fear, but I managed to work through it quickly, especially because of my boyfriend and getting to spend alot of time with him, which strengthened our relationship alot. 

Summer 2020 rolled around and things started becoming rough. I thankfully got a job (which is super difficult for a student atm) but it took alot out of me since I went from 0 days a week of work to 5 at a new, quite exhausting job. At the same time my mom got sent to the hospital which took a big toll on me, since I couldn't be there to support her because of work. Everything turned out OK with her after a few days and she got diagnosed with a rare, bad case of migraines. 

After that times got relatively quiet. My boyfriend and I stayed inside most of the time like the good citizens we are and minded our own business. Days became the same, every day had the same schedule and then college hit me with a super long exam period which took all of the energy I've gotten back after the summer out of me. At the same time my mom started talking alot about what she had heard from experts on covid and the vaccine and the govermnets and how covid isn't that bad and that the vaccine is rushed and how the governments lie to us. Daily phone calls turned into daily information meetings where she told me everything she found on alternative media outlets. My mother is an intelligent woman and alot of the things she found started to sound reasonable, to an extend. The people she listened to had alot of experience and knowledge about things and at first I didn't mind listening to her because I believe that you have to see things from both sides, but I think it has started to take a toll on me. 

For months now I have grown more and more annoyed by my friends and people around me. I feel like no one around me is using their head anymore. Every snap I get from friends is some kind of drama that is either ridiculously childish or straight up Karen (especially one female friend I got) and it has driven me to several yelling rants about it. It had gotten so bad that I can barely meet up with my class mates/friends without getting ridiculously angry or annoyed on the inside. I have realised that I have no more empathy for people and I feel like I have no energy left for anything nowadays. 

On top of that comes the constant stress about both my moms health and my boyfriends current situation. He has been trying for over a year to get any kind of job but sadly hasn't even gotten invited to an interview and he also struggles with depression, that has gotten better over the years, and not being able to make alot of friends. He has always been an introvert but the last few years he has tried to be more outgoing, but ever since corona hit, he has become more and more introverted again, to the point that he sees it himself that he is barely able to even say hi to my neighbours. 

I do not know what to do with myself anymore, I am constantly stressed, annoyed and exhauste to the point where I can barely passionately hug my boyfriend anymore because I can't get into the mood. I have tried to relax, but since most things are closed to the public I can't relieve stress with the usual methods I have and instead I can only use one relaxation method that works but also doesn't work. (Smoking jazz cigarettes) I don't feel like I can asked my mom to stop talking with me about all the stuff she finds, because then she won't have anyone to talk to about it. 

I appreciate everyone that took the time to read this and I would like to thank anyone in advance that has some advice that they might share. It felt weird to write so much about ""me"", but lately I haven't been able to talk about anything mental wise to anyone.",mentalhealth,2021-01-22 06:13:06

Not because I don't want to, but because I physically/mentally can't. I never struggled with any eating disorders such like anorexia, in fact, I always wanted to gain a little bit more weight just to feel better about my body.
It started out of no where, I was eating normally just a week ago but then I wasn't. No traumatic events or anything like that occurred. The thought of food disgustes me so much, to the point where I'm nauseous the whole day and even throwing up (not really tho, because there isn't any food in my stomach). I tried several times to eat even the smallest bites of food I like, but feeling the food in my mouth makes me to automatically throw up.
It came to the point where I can't think of anything else other than ""I need to eat, I have to eat"". It's the first thing I think about when I wake up, I get nauseous and can't fall back asleep.
I tried distracting myself while trying to eat (watching videos, Tv shows, etc) but it doesn't work, I can't even pay attention to them and all I think about is the food, making me feel even more sick.
I should add that I don't have any other physical symptoms, aside from the ones from not eating (low energy, shaky body), so this is purely something mental.
I'm feeling miserable and hopeless, I'm not getting better and I don't know what to do. I know there's something wrong with me but I don't know where to start. I want to start going to a psychologist/psychiatrist but the eating issue can't wait until I get an appointment and all that. Should I go to an ER? Has someone ever experienced something similar?

This might be the reason why I never been pushed to have put through the testing when younger to get a diagnosis. I know I was supposedly supposed to get more detailed testing at a bigger facility then the one I went to for therapy as a child. In my late teens I had also attempted to see if I have autism by going back to therapy but stopped pursuing it once it was going to take more effort then I was willing to give. My therapist gave me this take home test thing to do that I was to do with my parents. It was to reflect how I was as a child and if based on how the test went I either don't have a form of autism or I might have but need to be tested more. My therapist said based on my test she would clear me for further testing cause I could possibly be autistic. I chose not to due to the testing facility being kinda far from my house. I do believe I might have some form of autism tho and dont really want to get formally diagnosed just for them to tell me something I already know. Idrk, if I should try to pursue the diagnosis again and actually go through with it or not. Knowing 100 percent that I am would help and answer/explain so much tho. Is it harder for someone in their 20s to get a diagnosis and what are some of the some big signs of autism in adults?",mentalhealth,2021-01-22 07:12:37

Anxiety is a mental condition and the ways to cure it is found inside your own head. It takes a lot to be willing to really look at yourself as well as your life in order to get started with accepting the changes that are ideal to heal your condition.

**Cognitive Therapy**

Cognitive [anxiety therapy](http://www.tanuchoksi.in/) has its major focus on how you think, and it is often seen that people’s thinking patterns tend to lead them to having anxiety attacks. Anxiety starts as a worry, which becomes excessive, leading to unexpected anxiety attacks. Cognitive anxiety therapy has a major role to play in helping you learn how to stop those thinking patterns. The whole idea of cognitive therapy is to change the way you think and enable yourself to break the old habits that lead you to excessive worrying. The techniques used in this therapy includes ways to help you slow down and evaluate your thoughts while also gaining control over it. Some of the techniques are talking slower, stopping negative thoughts from contaminating your mind and using a rational approach to tackle your feelings.

**Behavioral Therapy**

[Behavioral therapy for children](http://www.tanuchoksi.in/speciality/child-therapy/) and adults is about taking everything you learned in cognitive therapy and applying it to your everyday life. You learn to react differently to others and to the number of situations you face without triggering any hint of anxiety attacks. You learn to act in a very conscious way during behavioral therapy, which means you start controlling your thoughts and feelings while also applying everything that you learned in cognitive therapy. Behavioral therapy is pretty much a challenge as well as a reward, because you tend to regain control over your own self.

**Emotional Therapy**

Cognitive and behavioral anxiety therapy lead you to emotional therapy, which is used to address a number of triggers, especially the ones that are related with stress and the feelings that you must have under control. Anxiety is often the result of stress and the need to control a string of emotions. It is important to learn to beat these two things in order to do well in treating and curing your anxiety. Emotional therapy is all about stress relief and getting you into a calm state of mind. The things you can do to make yourself feel better are yoga, meditation, exercise and a little peaceful time amidst nature.

The key to healing anxiety is inside your mind. Thanks to cognitive and behavioral therapy, you will definitely find it better to understand your condition while also being able to control it. You will learn to control your thoughts and feelings, that once had a strong hold on your life decisions. Thus, be it an anxiety therapist or a [marriage and family therapist](http://www.tanuchoksi.in/speciality/family-therapy/), their one and only aim is to give you your life back in a way that you know exactly how to hold it right.",mentalhealth,2021-01-22 07:47:16

I have completely lost faith in life. The country I live in and the government I live under were something I used to take pride in, and something I used to seek safety in. I thought that my life was going to be long and prosperous even from a young age, I was beaming with positivity. I was never the smartest child but I made people laugh and I could read people very easily. I was sure I would be given equal treatment and a fair chance at gathering enough resources to lead a comfortable life, I mean all you learn about as a child points to one thing, the progression of the human race. Now if one was to put 2 and 2 together as a small child, they would naturally assume that all basic human requirements would be met because people have been to space and returned, we have grown as a species for millennia and created financial and medical eco systems to support human life. I realised this was not the case as I started to look at the world around me and more importantly, my world. I would wake up to a broken household where my parents would have daily arguments, sometimes leading to what I can only describe as domestic abuse. There were a few instances of physicality that were exposed to me as a child, and this left me with a feeling that I lived more in an arena than a home. I grew up in an English City that was known for being rough around the edges but a few blocks could make the difference between a good and a terrible day to day life. Money was tight and dodgy internal affairs left my family reeling in debt, causing my parents relationship to dry out and our interfamily relations ceased to exist from that point onwards. We had incidents regularly, such as bailiffs coming to the house, police visits and general local crime rates soaring, violent crime and drug use spiralled out of control in my quiet neighbourhood due to what I later found out was a failing of the government to provide police structures and authorities in my local community cutting officers left right and centre. It was common knowledge that the police would not help you if you became a victim, nor would they even show up if you needed them. Knowing this and watching countless physical conflicts as a youngster in my local area and within my family led me to the assumption that violence was self-preservation in the most basic of fashions and the most active and successful form of self-defence. 

As I started to reach an age where adults no longer treat me with the kindness and softness with which you treat a child, I realised that I too was part of this world and from what I had seen it was not about prospering anymore, it was about surviving. During these growing years I suffered quite badly, I was flagged for having a mood disorder at my school with possible links to depression at age 14. This was the result of the inevitable, as I grew up and went about my life, I was placed in situations that still feel raw when I think about them now. I was attacked multiple times walking home from the gym, I was had a robbery attempt on me more than once. I have had a knife pulled on me 5 times in total between the ages of 13 and 19 and was part of countless fights becoming a nearly monthly occurrence. Surrounding this was a cloud of addiction, addiction “Runs In the family” as my dad says, and sadly it seems to be true. All 7 of my uncles are alcoholics and I had a cousin who died from a heroin overdose about 17 years ago. The whole time I was experiencing this, my view of what life was and what it should be shifted drastically, I started feeling like I was playing a game with no option to save, making every move pointless but I was also desperate to get somewhere before it was taken away from me.   

I suffered from bullying in school quite badly, leading to more fighting and I became the problem child of the class in a way. I was scared of fighting and I hated it, getting tunnel vision and getting hurt, feeling shocked and embarrassed afterwards. Followed by the shakes and sometimes vomiting. But it was a reality and one which I quickly came to understand, was my reality. I understood that I was an outsider and I had me myself and I.  

The only respite I would get would be watching cartoons by myself or walking in my garden with a football, I used to feed strays in my area and I ended up taking in a cat during a snowstorm about 6 years ago, he was a very young cat and I felt pity for him. He ended up piecing a bit of me back together as silly as it sounds and he still lives with me until this day. I am thankful for him and he is thankful for me, and trust me I was never a cat guy. I was convinced they reeked of \*\*\*\*. 

Moving on. 

The main issue then changed to anxiety episodes. I suffered separation anxiety from my house, I felt agoraphobic in public and crowds made my fuse 99% shorter. I still have a problem with crowds because every time I have been jumped, I have been outnumbered and usually by myself. This carried on throughout school giving me a whole sea of mental health issues. Sleep insomnia, depression, mood swings, de-realization etc. These things were not only new to me, but unbelievably hard to understand and recognise. De-realisation was something I thought was normal, I rarely felt connected to those around me, I didn’t feel massively at home and safe I just knew that was the way things were but it didn’t offer me any comfort. growing older I questioned why so many people needed other around them for mental health support and now I realise, I had no support and therefore a poor quality of life but I thought this was normal. 

My parents eventually split up leading to my mum effectively self-isolating due to depression which I understand, my brother was never really around which I don’t blame him for but this left me to wander around my house alone every day after school and all day on weekends. I lived very far from my friends and travel options were limited, so was money so I used to feel kind of stuck far away from everyone. Food became a problem as I didn’t really know how to cook at the age of 11/12 and my diet consisted of canned food that I could microwave with cups of tea. This caused me to revert into what can only be described as self-isolation, but i was convinced I was experiencing solitude, the reality is that being distant and detached brought me less pain than connecting to people and situations around me. This went on for around 2 years, leading to my dad moving into the property to look after us. My family are very money oriented even though they have always lacked it, my dad's only role in the house was to go to work and pay the bills. The rest was up to us, cleaning washing eating and doing laundry. He suffered greatly with alcoholism and was quite a violent man when I was growing up so I did not ask for much from him, but he is still my dad and looked after us the only way he knew how, by providing a house with a roof. The debt that followed my family had not left and due to high gas prices from the gas supplier and a barely insulated house we went £2k into debt over one year. The worst part is that the radiators were inefficient and the landlord would not change them so we were still mostly cold throughout that year. This was only one mound in the pile of debt we had accrued. 

This led to me and my father and me growing some cannabis to try and offset the debt, so my routine became going to school, having some trouble there and then coming home to trim dry and pot the plants we had. I lived in fear of repercussion for a while, without my dad I was alone in the world, he was suffering badly from mental health issues and probably wouldn’t have survived prison, and I myself did not want a record as I still had a hope for a brighter future. Everday I told myself it was necessary for our survival, which it was. You never stop needing food on the table, and with hundreds of pounds coming out of my dad's small monthly wage, we had no control over where it left us or how much he paid. But any cash we had was ours. I would hear stories of people being attacked with acid, stabbed and beaten by gangs in grow house break-ins and we lived in a prolific area for this sort of crime. By this point I was angry, I was tired and I was wishing every day that I was never born, this feeling has not gone away, it led to an even darker time from around age 18 to age 20. I was progressing within a building apprentice by the time i was 17, trying to earn my own money because Uni was not an option. I was paid £3.20 an hour. I worked 11–12-hour hard labour days in all weather and I would be paid only for 8 of those hours at my hourly rate of £3.20 which was national min wage for 1st year apprentices. This made me angry, very angry actually to the point where I started becoming suicidal. Since anger is a secondary emotion, I can only assume the primary feeling was hopelessness, and a feeling of inequality. This went on for a while and with managers refusing to pay wages and my effort never being recognised I started to dance on the line of criminality and addiction outside of work. I bought a motorbike and got a licence. i started doing everything you are advised not to do. Speeding, purposely doing things to see if I would crash. I used to wear shorts and ride my bike at 80+ mph. The fact I am actually still alive amazes me, I cannot count the number of times I crashed the bike and came away only with minor injuries, I used to dream about the crashes almost hoping for a different ending. I was at one point involved in the selling of drugs, and was part of multiple criminal groups of people mainly on a friendship basis. I was chased by police on motorbike, in car and on foot. Only a few people know of this and even my family don’t know about these incidents. I became probably my most violent at this point, doing things which I was sure would come with legal repercussions but they simply amounted to nothing. Also, for some context I am not a big guy and do not have any unmatched physicality. I am around 5’9 and 140 LBS for some context and I have never purposely been the aggressor but I have been the aggravator on more than one occasion. 

I turned my life around and bounced from a few jobs, struggling to settle. I am now waiting on my college to qualify me, but they have shortened the course and offered no help, this mixed with very poor communication has resulted in the possibility of un-processed paper work affecting my whole working future, and lockdown mixed with social isolation has sparked my cannabis use to a level it's never been causing my mental health issues to skyrocket past anything Ive seen. And now I'm just waiting to start another job hoping it will give me enough money to survive. 

However, I do have a plan, and if that plans fails, I will adapt. Everything is temporary, good times and bad. So long as I am qualified, I will return to this field of work and train my \*\*\*\* off until I am paid for what I am worth. Perhaps I may start my own business. Perhaps I will start a family. Perhaps I will start neither. 

I wrote this for people who may be sad about losing their optimism about life and its capabilities. I hope someone can find some comfort in knowing that life is difficult for many, but achievements are still abundant you just have to work for them. Give up control over things that you know are already out of your control, and use your energy wisely. Allow some fluidity into your life and give new things a try, stagnancy is progressions most critical enemy. You might be thinking, well the story hasn’t had a nice ending so why is he telling me to be positive? 

My story isn't over yet and I don’t know the ending. 

If you're reading this then your story isn't over yet either.  

Do not give up.

My sister and I are in our twenties, and she struggles with ""pure O"" OCD (I'm sorry if that's not the correct terminology), which she explained to me as being afflicted with thoughts that she just can't get rid of. There has been some friction in the past between her and I because I simply don't understand what it's like to have OCD, and for a long time, I think I've been harboring that subconscious thought that ""yeah, well, you just gotta get over it, ya know?"" I've never said that in such direct terms to her, but it definitely colored the way that I interacted with her.

I'm not saying that my attitude is 100% better now because I still don't know what it's like to have OCD, but I realize that I need to be better, and I just don't know what to do. She has been suffering pretty badly the past few weeks because she's become fixated on a medical issue that both she and I acknowledge is objectively trivial, but one that causes her extreme distress because she just can't shake the idea that it might mean something deeper is wrong with her, and I feel like she's withdrawing a bit as a result, obsessively looking up her symptoms, looking up what other medical conditions her symptoms might be related to, etc. Thankfully, she lives with her boyfriend, so she isn't completely ""unattended"", but I still think about her a lot.

My question is, what is the thing I can do now that would help her the most? Is it to let her retreat into a place that feels safe for her and leave her be until she feels better? Should I try to get her to engage with me? Like, call her up or try to get her to chat on the phone once in a while even if she doesn't feel like it? I've been sending her pictures of my cat around once a day and told her that she doesn't need to feel like she needs to respond, as a ways of maybe ""cheering her up"", but maybe this is actually not good?

Please tell me what I should do, and what can be done to make things easier for her. I want to make it clear that I want her to know that she's a good person, and I don't want to hurt her.",mentalhealth,2021-01-22 09:36:43

I lost my first sister in 2016 and my other sister in july 2020, now I'm an only child and having a bit of a rough time 

I moved across the country and resettled, started grad school in August 2020

first semester went good but this Christmas break i got pretty upset about my grief

spring semester has started and I've realized I need to see a therapist. I get set up w one through the school on Wednesday, and during that ""triage"" appt we basically talk about all the shit ive had trouble with -  yknow very open and raw after the fact. 

later that same day I had class (via zoom) and I didn't really talk much and one of my classmates (female) texted me later that day asking if I was doing OK. She had just moved across country herself after last semester taking courses remotely.

I told her ab my sisters and Christmas and that I had seen a therapist. She invites me to our male classmates house the next day for dinner and a movie. after a few texts I express that this sounds like it was a date idea between her and him and not like a group activity I could join- I say this makes me feel weird and maybe we should just raincheck for when we can get a group together

she insists it isn't like that, I eventually get in contact with the guy and he also tells me it isn't like a date between them at all.

So I agree to go over and it 100% is a date between them, they're drinking and she is going to spend the night, and I feel like I was lied to by both parties. I felt like a third wheel and generally felt weird. It generally is causing me to overthink things, so I am looking for an outside opinion (before my next appt on Monday)

I dont think they did anything wrong? but I still feel lied to and like my words were not respected? also I feel like judgemental and that I'm feeling like I am entitled to, idk. a different level of attention?

I'm not gonna tell them they did anything wrong of course I'm just trying to work this out myself.

My mind is plagued with emotions and memories, ones that are far from good. A few years ago I had a really good group of friends, but I lost them because I was unstable, then I lost the rest of my friends because I isolated myself out of spite. I hated them, they had everything, a body they could love, a relationship, confidence, the ability to talk without stuttering or fucking up your words. 

I dont even have a talent. Now I can barely talk to anyone, I'm down to only one friend, and soon she'll be gone to. I haven't accomplished even one thing in my life compared to other people, I'm sixteen years old, turning seventeen on Feburary 1st. When is my life going to start? Haven't had a job, dont even have my license. 

All I feel is hate and pain, it feels like that's what I'm slowly turning into. I take this out on myself, cutting, screaming on the inside, trying to blow my eardrums out with music. Few months ago I tried to kill myself by overdosing, didnt work though, woke up the next day and no one ever found out. Can't even kill myself right. 

My mom told me she planned on aborting me, but she didnt because she had a dream of a little boy saying ""mommy dont do this."" The only reason I'm alive is because of a fucking dream. Before that my mom got into an accident, a guy hit her in his car while she was walking home from school. Her body got flung up several feet into the air, her brain was literally hanging out. 

The doctors said it was a miracle she lived. I hate her, so much, I'm gay and she can't even accept me, she says if I ever came out to her she would disown me. I dont have parents or friends to go to. I have no one. I'm all alone. 

Sometimes I try to envision myself as fictional people I admire from shows/games/movies. Would it be so wrong if I tried to become like them? To be them. I mean I dont even have a personality, maybe modeling myself after someone else could help me. 

I want to kill myself, I want to slit my wrists and bleed to death, I want others, those who hurt me but still claim to love me and claim to be family, to hurt. I want them to feel the pain i feel. If i killed myself i could do that, and i could finally feel peace. 

My family won't even let me Express myself, my sexuality, my appearance, I can't do anything I want if its ""gay"" or not ""normal"" 

I used to have a boyfriend, I loved him, but he did nothing but break me down and tell me I'm not good enough. Eventually he told me to kill myself. All I ever wanted in life was to be loved. To have a boyfriend that I could spend the rest of my life with. To have friends. To be admired. To be beautiful. To be unique. I want to help others, to make others feel better. But I can't even help myself. 

I'm not normal
I'm fucked up
I'm wrong
Im ugly
Im broken
Im screaming 
Im dying
Im alone
Im sad
I'm angry
I'm hated 
Im not loved
I'm not supposed to exist

Recently, my (20m) girlfriend(21F) was diagnosed with borderline personality disorder (BPD) I’ve known for awhile she has had some sort of mental health issues and it hasn’t interfered with anything until lately. 

A few weeks ago she went in and got some meds to help with her I’m not even sure what to call it, basically to sum it up, she tells me that “anytime she thinks of something good about her life, her brain will twist it into something bad” she will always assume I’m mad or upset with something, whether it be while we’re watching tv, in the car, or even just laying in bed. It usually will always end in her crying as well.

I’m not sure what they prescribed to her but she has told me in the past they’ve given her the same stuff. It seems since she just got them again everything has just gone down hill, very little things will upset her and make her come very sensitive to whatever it is that was either said or done. I don’t know how to come across, or even what BPD is. I’ll ask her to talk to me about how she is feeling but I always get the same response “I can’t describe it all” 

I can tell that there is something wrong almost everyday, and I get she has some mental health issues and I just want to know if there is anything I can do or if this something that she has to do on her own or even go to a therapist and talk to a professional about.

My (21M) girlfriend (20F) has been battling some mental health issues for a while now with zero support from her parents, in fact, they are strictly and openly opposed to her getting help. 

We have been together for 4 years now and within the past 2.5 years, her mental health has been steadily declining. Obviously not a mental health professional but it seems as if she has some form of severe anxiety and depression. 

I’m turning to Reddit to ask on what to do... we have tried everything that is not therapy or medications to no success. My girlfriend brings her struggles up to her parents just for them to say, “everyone gets sad sometimes, you just have to think about happy stuff. You’re so lazy, all you ever do is sit in your room. I don’t believe in therapy or mental issues, it’s all a big scam.” She has tried multiple times and there is no changing her parents minds. 

The problem is, she needs professional help. We both go to university so there’s resources there but its not free. I think she should make appointments and use her parents health insurance anyway but she says that her parents will check the bill and punish her for seeking help. We are both broke college kids and cannot pay for therapy or doctors appointments out of pocket.

When he doesn’t want anything from me, he’s a bit extra cold to me and he only cares about the other guys.

Anyways, today he tried to greet me like “hey you wanna join this with me(something abt this scholarship thing to japan, since he knows i want to travel there)
Wanting to start saying no to others i tried being a bit cold(that sounds cruel im sorry), so i said
“Im good”

Sure enough his true colors shows, he asked me that he wants one of my ps4 games.
This really started pissing me off so i simply said, “No”.
I can tell he’s angry but idfc. And this where the trouble came, started feeling guilty being cold or saying “no”. What’s wrong with me, i dont want to keep being used like a puppet, but here i am feeling guilty quickly.

I just want to distance myself from other people lately because of a previous problem(my previous post here)

Since mid last year, I noticed that I’m starting to have an extremely bad memory. 

The past year has been too much for me to handle and I have been suffering from bad anxiety and extreme burnout. I am not diagnosed but I’m just talking about the general physical symptoms of anxiety such as palpitations, sweating, light-headedness, sleep deprivation. Anyways, I noticed how bad my memory is because whenever I talk to someone about something, I would always forget what they said just moments later. Another thing is, whenever I would call someone about something, when they would answer, I would ALWAYS forget what I was gonna say so I would always blabber until I remember what I was going to say. The worst thing is, whenever I remembered something important, I would always doubt myself that the really happened and it was just my ‘imagination’ until I have confirmed it from other people.

I was never like this. This all started last year. Is anxiety and memory correlated to each other? I don’t know what to so cause it’s affecting my job badly. No money to get help",mentalhealth,2021-01-22 11:01:19

My wife is my wife not a therapist or counselor, although she is very good at listening. I am her husband, and I'd like to think the same about myself. We don't know the solutions, but we try to give ideas when we think is appropriate. 

I have seen 2 therapists for brief times, but I feel like I started off on the wrong foot with them, focusing on the wrong things. I also can't help but doubt them. Who is this outsider that I'm talking to? How can they understand the complex interconnected things that happen in my life to help me unravel my problems that I've mostly brushed under the rug, but are eating away at my mind every day? How can I afford seeing them regularly?

I wish I had a closer connection with my family, and I wish I had friends, but every time I try to reconnect or maintain my relationships, I feel such a huge weight of obligation: I'm not proud of my life right now and don't want to talk about that, but I really don't want to really have the emotional energy to genuinely care about their lives. A prime example, my estranged biological father's father passed very recently. I don’t recall him at all, but my mother says he met me when very very young. I told him I feel sorry for my father, but I was tempted to tell my father 2 months ago to just stay out of my life because he already abandoned me at 5 and has offered bonding time too little too late in my now busy adult life.

The medication and the PTSD really messed with my sleep cycle and my family doctor told me that I should just take melatonin. Also I was a new parent at the time and my doctor told me it was normal to not be able to sleep well. After a while I built up a tolerance to the melatonin and I would have panic attacks about not being able to fall asleep and stay asleep. My child wasn't breastfeeding at that time so I started taking over the counter sleep aids but my husband got upset because after I built up a tolerance to them I was taking 3x the recommended dose. I would often switch between taking gravol and the over the counter sleep aids. My husband got me to 'quit' but I spent a few months miserable because I wasn't sleeping. So in secret I have now been buying Bendery because I find it helps me sleep and I don't build up a tolerance. I've also had to hide the pills and hide using them every night and I have been doing it for months. My addiction to sleep aids has been off and on for 2 years now and my husband always gets so disappointed in me. He can't even handle my mental health issues any more so I have to hide my addiction from him as well. I can't seek professional help either because each time I got help for self harm (Yeah I used to cut too and every now and again I relapse) my counsellor would contact the authorities and I would get treated like I was a risk to my child. Both times I was investigated they said I was a good parent just with some mental health problems.

I think my addition and mental health problems are caused by my past traumas and my current lack of self care. I often feel burnt out from caring for my child and husband. I also feel like my husband is burnt out because of all my mental health issues. I push all of my issues aside so I can be the best mother I can be and the best wife I can be. I also get emotionally abused by my parents but I can't cut them from my life because they support me in other ways. I can't let my husband know I'm struggling because the last time I had a mental breakdown he threw me out of the house because he couldn't handle it. I've offered to leave permanently with no string attached if my husband felt like he couldn't handle me anymore but he says I'm a great wife and I just have my bad moments. I felt like if he knew the full truth he would loose all trust and respect for me.

I live in Canada, and if I was to get help it would have to be some way I could do it anonymously. I can't rely on family any more and I don't have any friends.",mentalhealth,2021-01-22 11:22:02

Lately I’ve been feeling really depressed and horrible and I just want to talk to someone. I don’t expect my friends to fix or help the situation at all, I just want someone to be there and listen to me sometimes when it gets really bad. Which has been kind of a lot lately. And I completely understand having boundaries and feeling drained when people vent to you, so I don’t do it a lot and I respect when people are tired of me talking. 

However, ALL of my friends have been like this. Each time I talk to them when I’m feeling really bad they just tell me “I’m sorry, I can’t help, I don’t know what to do”. And I find this weird because I don’t want them to help, I just want them to listen sometimes. The fact that they just seem really drained whenever I try to talk to them makes me not want to, because I want to respect how they feel and not be a negative influence on their mood. 

I really don’t know what to do, I just feel like I’m a huge burden and really alone. I don’t feel comfortable talking to my parents or a therapist (not really an option for me) so I just feel like I’m really by myself. I can’t make people sympathize with me. 

This also might be kind of wrong of me, but I don’t really like talking to one of my friends because I just think they kind of make me feel worse sometimes. They’re always pointing out how kind of immoral my feelings can be (like jealousy, etc.) and it just makes me feel horrible. I know it’s wrong, you don’t need to tell me that.

After avoiding him - which, granted, isn't hard when you're living in another country - for weeks, my anxiety about it growing to a point where I actually couldn't bring myself to talk to him, I finally just dialled his number. Without giving it a second thought. 

He didn't even ask about my university-related future when he heard about my mental health worsening, asked if I needed anything, listened to me explain the details about the hospital stay and my current mood. 

Hell, he didn't leave without making sure that I had someone to go to if I had a sudden depressive moodswing or just in general, telling me I could always call him instead. 

This is how parents probably should react, but I know a lot of them don't - and I certainly didn't expect him to.

I don’t get it and I don’t know how to describe it. It’s so much. I quit workin in November due to anxiety and had a pretty solid breakdown, not a first, but previously I (21f) had low-responsibility jobs where I could hide my symptoms and just hustle through. In December, I started seeing a therapist (after a month of desperately trying to find help). aftr a 2-session assessment, she requested I have a psychiatric assessment before continuing therapy.

I am no longer in crisis, but this was not a first and certainly won’t be the last. I received therapy and monitoring by a psychiatrist in my teens...through much of which I struggled to sverbalise my feelings. I shut down when I’m stressed, and I’m scared that after months of seeking help, I won’t be able to tell the. what is wrong.  I’m hoping if I list some of what I experience here, some lovely strangers might help me make sense / contextualise my xexperience, as well as an exercise ofor myself to organize my thoughts


🍊your regular physical anxiety troubles: chest pain, heart palpitations, occasional nausea. most began when i was a kid, 2 years ago I began feeling like my throat was closing (I thought I’d developed an alllergy at first)

🍊insomnia and nightmares

🍊feeling discinnected from my body + the world. limbs Feel heavy, its sometimes very hard to speak when upset/overwhelmed. 
🍊trouble concentrating, feeling restless/frustrated/almost scared? When I have to listen to someone talk when I was concentrated on domething else. Frequently struggle to follow conversations and read (it’s made uni hard)

🍊 feeling ominous ‘presences’. Sounds strange, I know...I find it very disturbing. Not crazy regular anymore though.
🍊 self harm: I used to be addicted. I haven’t been for many years. I often hit myself, and sometimes scratch. These feel compulsive. I often don’t realise I’m doing it till I’ve done it

🍊sometimes certain body positions are really soothing. I can mitigate to not draw attention in public, but sometimes my body just wants to bend sideways or rock in certain patterns. It feels uncomfortable to do otherwise
🍊heightened senses
🍊confused senses? What see/feel/hear seems...fragmented? I don’t understand what’s happening. Time seems diffetent. I have no idea how to describe these moments. It’s like the info coming in gets filtered by my fears/imagination and, for a moment, I can’t tell what’s actually going on
🍊I feel fragmented. Or like pieces of me are going to crumble away
🍊sometimes I feel high, without getting high. Usually after a long period of anxiety
🍊I could live in my imagination, and have extremely vivid visual memories. Sometimes I can’t stop daydreaming. For days I’m distracted, I’ve nearly been hit by a few cars and crashed one due to this or heightened/overwhelmed sense (I no longer drive if I feel anxious/disctracted)

I can see he is really struggling but I don’t want him to just stay on his own everyday get drowned by his thoughts. However I think he feels like he is dragging everyone down.

I was meant to go round last Saturday but he isolated himself and I didn’t end up going. However he said I could go around Sunday instead which I did. Things weren’t great though as he was in a bad place, and I asked him why he had been ignoring me (which was probably due to depression but I think I upset him) 

Anyway I asked him Wednesday if I could come see him after work and he said no he was busy but to come round the next day. Then a couple hours later he got fired from his job. Which obviously isn’t great considering his mental state. I figured he would be busy yesterday getting things in order after being fired and might need some space so said “let me know when I can come around” but all he said was “okay” and I don’t know if he will even let me know. He is the kind of person you sometimes have to be quite direct with. 

He isn’t doing well again today and I want to go see him tomorrow. I feel like he needs a distraction or someone there with him. However I fear if I ask he will just ignore me because he often does when he withdraws. He does live with his grandparents so isn’t alone but hardly talks to them. I read online it can be helpful just to say “I’m coming over at this time, do you want me to bring anything” but I feel like that is intruding on his space and choice. What should I do?

is that you cannot understand it
without having experienced it. 
Words can only go so far.  
Even the most descriptive of adjectives
fall short and cannot truly convey 
the depth of depression's ruthlessness.
You have to feel it. 

The thing about depression 
is that it's so easy to despise it
and to pray for its demise. 
You become entangled in it's clutches
but slowly the hate is replaced with ambivalence. 
You loathe its existence yet simultaneously
Long for its comforting embrace. 
Depression is safe.  

The thing about depression 
is that it's terrifying to both love and hate it. 
It's a confounding relationship with 
grey, blurry boundaries. 
You want it to leave you alone 
but you don't want it to abandon you.
You long for it's embrace 
while yearning for separation. 

The thing about depression
is that you can't write about depression. 
Not truly. Not accurately. 
The thing about depression 
is that no one will ever be able to comprehend 
the tangled web inside your mind.

People are not given the tools to deal with the stress of modern day problems. If given the tools I believe thousands of lives will be saved and unnecessary suffering will be prevented. 

Dealing with mental health issues is a sign of strength and not weakness.

I want to see more celebrities and influencers stand up for further funding from federal and state governments that action mental health. This is a cause that is very close to home.

If I can have your support it would mean the world to me, can I get a post of ""I sign up to your vision"" below so I know that I am not alone.",mentalhealth,2021-01-22 13:10:40

I just don't get it. How is there not enough evidence for this person to be put on COT? I'm a behavioral health technician in a crisis recovery unit. This patient was voluntary- not on court ordered treatment. How the hell is this person just going to get away with it? 
And the detective working with me (not related to the petition for COT) says the offence isn't a ""sexual assault"", it's ""assault with sexual intent."" 

So backstory- yeah i was in a super shitty marriage. This has all been a trigger to when my ex husband used to shoot me up and do whatever he wanted to me. So so many other types of abuse were present, but this is the one I haven't come to terms with. And this whole thing... Its just destroying my mental health. The progress I had made was already fragile at best, and I am very prone to picking anger as my default emotion. 

I have a strong support system, i have been through counseling and am studying it as well, i work in the field... I know im supposed to remain calm but i cant. I know self medicating is not the answer but i want to drown myself in alcohol right now. I'm surprised i'm not wanting to shoot up, honestly. I guess i'm too mad? 

Anyone willing to give me ideas, i would greatly appreciate it. I've got so much knowledge of what to do but... Its just gone and the rage is setting in. And the worst part is that I WANT to be mad. I LOVE being mad. It's my most comfortable emotion.

I do know that I have social anxiety, I get anxious talking to people, also I have poor social skills...If you'd ask me a question you'd probably receive an awkward answer.

I am aware that all this social anxiety is in my brain, and it is a result of evolution for thousands of years. Seems like the beings that were more shy had a good rate of surviving in that condition...So, I feel like social anxiety may help 'someone' survive for the better.

Now, while many people think that having social anxiety is just being shy or ""scared"", I think they should be knowing us with social anxiety more.

Throughout the school life, many students and teachers have thought of me as being that one ""nerd"" kid or the ""shy kid"", and many have underestimated me for being scared and trying to push me down for it, which made me even angrier.

I am usually quite and anxious socially, but when it comes to defending myself as a person, and when I feel like I am being pushed down, I get very mad and angry, which usually results on be doing things that people would never ever believe I would do.

Let's take for example a teacher I had, he always underesttimated be and tried to push me down, but not to the last point. One day, he really filled my cup and I just had enough of his bullshit, I went down to the hall, called angrily at him to come right where I was while he was in the ""teacher's office"", all the teachers were looking shocked while that one teacher was completely different, his face got red and he was just staring at me 10 meters away, I again shouted, ""come here, come"", and he came slowly, then I cursed at him, told him if hr has the balls to mess with me, let's do it now, I as well had a knife hidden on my pocket, I was dead serious and I wasn't thinking anything just trying to get in trouble with that one teacher.

He was completely shocked, barely able to say a word, then he told me calm down, and that he really ""never"" meant to do something on purpose, while I kept cursing at him and telling him that that shit couldnt be a joke.

The day ended like that, shit, but never ever again he underestimated me again, after that, he always greeted be and smiled (ofc a forced smile).

This shit happened do many times, I've attacked several people with knifes, even ran after them but ""unfortunately"" couldnt catch, today I had a similar case, only that I was in public someone swore at me for being a certain religion, and then he left. I do know that guy and I will meet him live next week, I am planning of confronting him with a knife and tell him that if he has the balls to say that in front of me, do it, I dont care what happens. I am also planning to buy a gun and carry it secretly.

All I want to say is, that dony fking underestimate people with poor social skills, while they are not good to keep a conversation, we certainly are people and think perfectly.

Next time you talk shit about us, keep in mind we are thinking of a way to get rid of you alive.

Dont fill the cup, I am talking about myself mostly, I dont care if I have other mental illness or if I am a psycho, but I certainly think a lot of horrible shit and what I would do to them in the future about the people I hate.

I think the sterotype ""shy kid carrying a bomb in backpack"" is not really that much of a sterotype.

I acknowledge I may be a psychopath or have angry issues, when I get mad I cant control myself.",mentalhealth,2021-01-22 13:58:26

He insists my weight gain is because of my eating. I eat the same thing every day. I didn't gain weight until I started this medicine. What is he, a Latuda salesperson? Why is it so hard to believe that I could possibly gain weight from this medicine?!

He said oh, you're likely putting butter on your bread or are drinking soda. SMFH!

I'm searching for another psychiatrist as we speak. He really pissed me off today. I also told him about all these things i'm experiencing including death anxiety only for him to tell me it's basically my fault. He said I chose to move away from my family! My family is TOXIC! They have never done anything for me! I had to get away from them! Moving states away was one of the best things I could have done for myself. I'm also lesbian and my family doesn't know but they're homophobic!

He basically insulted me. He said that what i'm experiencing is all situational and not biological. OK so if it's not biological, why are you prescribing me medicine?!

I want to be done with Latuda. It's making me fat. I'm a woman. I don't want to be fat. That in itself is enough to make me depressed. 

I'm having issues with loneliness and anxiety and feeling hopeless and death anxiety and hating myself and all he can say is here's a higher dose of wellbutrin and to move close to my toxic family!

I pay out of pocket to see this man but NO MORE! I'm booking with another psychiatrist. One who accepts my insurance and actually listens. Maybe the new one will tell me I can get off these meds altogether.

I've had anxiety problems my entire life that stemmed from bullying at a young age!

Queue entering hight school and I was introduced to pornography which would consume my life for the next 10 years. It warped who I am  how I viewed sexuality and deepened that pit of loneliness I have felt my entire life (I'm clean from porn now). I've drank excessively and used drugs in the past unconsciously numbing my pain as its use wasn't to intentionally numb myself! I've lost friends that I hurt because of how lonely I was and was such a toxic person cause all I wanted was to fill in the loneliness and insignificance I felt and didn't know how to communicate properly and seek help! I unintentionally manipulated people to make myself feel better! Its only with time I've realised what a horrible person I became all because I was insecure about who I was and didn't feel like I was ever good enough! It seems so ridiculous that a thing like insecurity could twist who I am. And the horrifying thing is I didn't know how my insecurity was affecting me or others! Its only with hindsight that I realised this! My intentions have always been good, I enjoy helping others, I enjoy learning and trying to improve who I am. But lately I feel like i can't escape who I was even though I am a completely different person now. I like who I am, I'm the person I thought I was during the lowest points of insecurity and loneliness. If I put myself now and who I was in a room its two vastly different people. But all the time that old me is in the back of my head telling me that I don't deserve to be happy and that I will lose everyone around me because of how I was in the past. And thats the root of what has troubled me my entire life, I'm lonely, afraid of being alone and afraid of feeling alone. ts ironic that acting out of that fear made me lose people because of my past toxicity.

Well news flash the job wasnt there and the roommate was a filthy dumpster of a person in all aspects.
My friend who is quite a messy dirty person leaves messes and doesnt do dishes, so as someone who likes a clean house (especially kitchen) I end up doing most of the dishes, due to their dirty habits and such I've gotten food poisoning several times and given the craps pretty bad each time, this has extended to fast food during 2020 I had gotten food poisoning upwards of 10+ times.
So now due to this crap I wash my hands every time I touch something before handling food, ( chopped some veg and rinsed em better wash my hands, touched the fridge handle better wash my hands, dried my hands and grabbing a drink better wash my hands) my hands are super dry cause of this.
Furthermore I cant eat out now without being filled with anxiety for several hours because I might get the craps.
I drink only bottled water and havent had a fresh crispy vegetable in over a year( I do eat veg just steamed or cooked) also got the craps from drinking the water here, so cant rinse a salad with confidence.
I get it, this is a major first world problem but man this shits getting old. I remember when I could go eat at a restaurant and not trip out, I miss eating big salads accompanied with a grilled piece of meat, a baked potato and sauteed mushrooms with onions.

its gonna sound so silly, but i basically asked him if i could take his energy drink yesterday, and as always he ignored me. bc thats a thing he does. he expects me to know the answer by reading his mind or sth idfk. so i jokingly said okay well ig imma just have to drink water. he laughed or sth i dont remember exactly. but im 100% sure that he didnt say yes nor no bc i was angry at him for that. so in the night i just took it bc i had a long school day. 
then today i got yelled at for taking it. thats not even the problem tho. like idc i know that if i deserve punishment then im gonna take it and sit my ass down, but i said that he didnt say yes nor no which just made him so fucking angry as always bc he's such a fucking crybaby and he yelled abt how im lying and how im just talking shit.

so i was like ""yeah alright dw i get it im always lying to u and im never right, its cool just let me eat now"" and like yeah ok i had a bit of an attutude but still. he always fucking yells at me and i always keep calm. but he cant handle me being frustrated once. jzst one fuckung time. and then he got even angrier and said how he never even insuated that and how im so disrespectful always shit. and i got scared that he was gonna take my phone which isnt a problem like i said im extremely okay w endzring consequences but i know he also wouldve gone through it bc he doesnt give a shit abt my privacy and i was scared so i just apoligzed and said i had a rough day and stuff.

like he was like ""yeah i could tell u why ur frustrated and cant concentrate. bzt then I'M the villain again, as always, bc im always lying"" LIKE I SAID THE SAME THING AND I GOT SO MUCH TROUBLE and then he was like ""oh yeah, its bc u never clean room. trust me, i know this bc of u would clean ur room, it would clean ur mind"" IM LITERALLY DIAGNOSED. i see a therapist. i came so far all by myself and now he's demeaning it by saying all of my troubles would be avoided if i just fucking cleaned my room as if that wasnt a byproduct of my depression. i fuvkisn hate it here. i always just wanted a dad but he always fucks my head up and i try so hard but he is so fucking weird and no matter what i do i can never commubiacte. i just want a dad. fuvk lmao. and now i cut myself again after 4 fucking years of not doing it. im so tired",mentalhealth,2021-01-22 14:15:45

Fuck everything and fuck everyone who did shit that affected me. Yeah u dont hate me and u actually like talking and hanging out with me, but doing petty shit against my bf because u guys had an argument, affected me too, which was really shitty of you. Idc if u arent mad at him anymore and u guys made up, you are one of the main reasons why my mental health is shit rn and if I can cut it out, I will, and I have.

So, on the exact day when I was born my family all tell me it was snowing and it was cold and then here I was, they brought me home in the snow. It rarely snows in England (lately it’s been snowing a lot though, icl) but today was the first day of January where it’s snowed. We were all just having fun and out of nowhere everyone is screaming “come outside” and we see it’s snowing. I don’t know why but I’m taking it as a sign that I’m exactly where I need to be and that I was supposed to make it to this day. I know it sounds a bit weird but yeah! 

Anyways, now I’m in bed watching movies and facetiming with my friends (Asif, Riaz and Rkay if you’re reading this I love you 🙄) listening to them sing happy birthday and all that off key. I honestly don’t want this day to end but even if it does I just know that when the clock strikes 12 I’m still gonna act like it’s my birthday. I really want to post the pictures &amp; videos I took but I can’t. But maybe I’ll do it in another post on my account if anyone wants to see? My younger brother said the same thing as me, that I’m not allowed to say I want to kill myself now because the snow is Allah’s way of telling me I belong here (I love you too Shamas)

My boyfriend and i are going to be 21 this year, and dating for 5 years. He, like 90% of the gen z population uses dark humor and joke about ""wanting to die"" which i dont really agree with personally. Long story short, (my post got taken down in AITA but if yall need to see, it should still be there under ""comments"") he will lean against talking about dying soon to get my attention.

For context, hes a child cancer survivor but recently had to do a surgery as recommended by the doctors to prevent it from growing back. So when i heard the news last year it absolutely broke me, and reassured him who was also upset about that that i will be there with him when time to operate. So tldr from aita post, i had an argument with him and instead of talking it out with me, he went straight to the ""i have little time left"" route and i really dont know what to say! He really has been doing that whenever we have any kind of argument and it has really taken a toll on my own mental health.

In a way, i notice him using that death talk method to bring the spotlight away from the problem. I have talked to him about it a few times, and he will ""change"" for a while, then go back to being suicidal. He is strongly against counselling for 2 reasons: too expensive and he feels the need to not bring a 3rd party into his problems and feelings. And yes i have tried convincing to no avail.

He might mentally not okay, or has unresolved childhood issues with parenting (his mom is divorced) , and at this point as someone who has no knowledge on how therapy or psychology works, i really dont know how to help him.

When i tried to breakup with him 2 years ago over how im done with his gaslighting ways, he went berserk and cried in public and begged me not to leave, and threatened to end his life. as im writing this im just shivering at the memory of what happened. Im from Singapore if it matters, and counselling /therapy from what i know, are expensive. I just wish that my 1st world country touches on mental health more and not make people like him see it as some kind of taboo. Not blaming my country though, just an opinion.

I just feel trapped in this situation and mentally tired from him.",mentalhealth,2021-01-22 15:23:43

Disclaimer: I have not been formally diagnosed with anything (and am a teenager so it could just be that) but I believe I have anxiety (social and maybe ocd due to obsessive thoughts) and maybe depression. It does run in my family so that’s a thing.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When I am in a situation where something slightly embarrassing has happened or a tiny bit traumatic I can make myself forget it somehow I don’t know how though. I just kind of walk out the room and as long as I move onto something else fast, poof it is gone. However if something really bad has happened, such as bad panic attacks or stressful situations, if I think about it long enough and slowly change the way things happened, usually by believing I’m in different parts of the room or I said things differently. I can make it so that I remember it happened but I can make it seem not as bad or as if I was someone else that witnessed it. If I don’t do it quickly enough I can’t change the memory’s though no matter how bad or mild (so I get obsessive thoughts pop into my head when my mind is not completely distracted).I don’t know if this is normal and I’m just a hypochondriac or if it could be actually dangerous.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Again please don’t be mad at me for not being diagnosed I know it’s a really big problem nowadays and I try not to but I think my anxiety can be really bad (not to say I have anxiety disorder) and I’m just trying to kind of understand my brain better.

I mean, whoever thought wearing a mask would become a standard accessory? Not me, so many changes. Sadly though, so much has remained the same. From my view, many of the things that need to change to keep us safe are being neglected. Most notable are the two tiered system we are all forced to live with.

For me, when the pandemic began, I was, like many of you, scared to death. I thought to myself, “What the hell is going on?” The world as I knew it seemed to make a permanent change overnight. If it weren’t permanent, other things about COVID-19 got penned under the category of undetermined.

EXPERTS WARN THAT MENTAL ILLNESS WILL BE THE NEXT PANDEMIC
The best example I can think of for this was the quarantine. No one could tell us how long we would remain in our homes. Although being stuck within the four walls of my home at the time was painful; it was not as painful for me as it was for most; I assume. Living with PTSD, I prefer the solitude that only being at home brings.

For me, being isolated was easy on my battle with PTSD. My depressive disorder, however, not so much. That was hell; its flames fuelled by the chronic worry that only clinical anxiety can bring.


 
Essentially, I was a hot mess but as up and down as I was; I could still put a lot of energy into thinking about how we can use those tragic times to identify some of society’s biggest social challenges or the lack thereof. Maybe this is exactly the type of thing we needed to force the changes that would better everyone’s lives.

Having what seemed like all the time in the world to solve these things, I concluded that this two tiered system has left the vulnerable even more so. What’s worse, a pandemic will leave an untold amount of people who lost loved ones and their jobs in this vulnerable category.I thought this is the time to push because this influx would have to get addressed.

Having said that, I am a mental health advocate; I have spent a lot of my time thinking about the potential damage COVID-19 would have on the pre pandemic and post pandemic populations. The ramifications, I thought, will be enormous.

COPING WITH MENTAL ILLNESS DURING THE PANDEMIC
So, after all that thinking, what did I conclude? I saw that the current mental health system as insufficient. What I was two main issues; One, the public system is severely under-funded and two, the private mental health care sector is too expensive for the many who were already suffering from a mental health condition. Now, as the dust settles and we are free to move about; many more people are in desperate for help. Makes sense, right? But if this broken, two tiered system was failing us before COVID, it was sure to leave those in need out in the cold afterwards.

THE IMPACT OF COVID-19 ON THE MENTALLY ILL.

Being through the public system, I saw how precarious it was before the world ground to a halt. So many people turned away or otherwise discouraged because of the long wait times that they give up trying.A sad and disturbing reality.

With this in mind, the pandemic excited me in a sense because I hoped that governments and citizens alike would see this two tiered system for what it is, divisive, costly and morally wrong.

Unfortunately, the “new normal” seems to only consist of social distancing and mask wearing. Other than that, it’s business as usual. What does this mean for us? Well, from my perspective, it’s also business as usual. So far, there has been no move to increase mental health funding, no legislative move to make the system accessible to everyone, and no outcry to demand change…. We can do and must do better.

However, we live in a society where money will always trump compassion and thus funding will always flow away from the right thing and into the corporate branch of our society. That is precisely why we need to merge our voices as one and insist on the necessary changes needed to get away from this two tiered system.

CHECKOUT THE BOOK I HELPED TO WRITE:
Lemonade Stand: Vol. III 

Created by Josh Rivedal and Kathleen Myre, Lemonade Stand: Vol. III is a compilation of 20 stories from those who have served in the emergency services and the military.  In it, the authors talk about their battles with PTSD, a debilitating and for many, a life-long mental illness.  So, if you are from the military or emergency service’s, perhaps this book can help you combat the feelings of isolation and fear that frequently comes with post-traumatic stress disorder. Sometimes, just knowing that there are others out there, just like you, can provide you with the strength and courage to speak up and or get the help you need. The intention of this book is to help with that…. You’re not alone.

Also, Lemonade Stand: Vol III was written to help combat the stigma that often accompanies mental illness, best of all, it attempts to give all you served their countries and communities a voice… Which is amazing!

I've been in a downward spiral for 2-3 weeks now, and without access to professional help I'm not going to get better (psych isn't calling me back and the crisis team don't answer the phone so professional help clearly not going to happen here)

I've cried almost constantly, been angry at the lack of healthcare, too scared/anxious to do anything but super amped up and wanting to do something to fix myself, even though I tried everything in my power already.

Now I suddenly feel super calm. My physical anxiety symptoms are still there, my pulse is fast and my hands are shaking and I flinch at every sound, but my mind feels... the opposite?

I stopped panicking about uni work, not because I'm confident I'll be able to do it but because I just don't care. As someone whose entire sense of self worth is based on academics, that's not a normal feeling. I don't care whether the bank decides to refund the fraudulent charges on my card even though I wouldn't be able to eat for a month if that money was actually gone.

I keep thinking that the calmness should be nice, I should prefer this to the crying and begging for the pain to stop even when nobody can hear me, I should be grateful I don't have that stress. But it's horrible. I can't explain how calmness can be this awful but it feels almost dangerous?

Is this an actual thing that people experience? Can I make it stop?",mentalhealth,2021-01-22 16:07:53

hi. im currently loosing my mind. yesterday my ex reached out to me, said she wanted me back, we were talking and figuring things out, today she tells me im not worth it, and now im loosing my mind in confusion and anger. i relapsed recently with some major past issues and i cant get these ideas out of my head. i so badly want to escape and get away from this horrible feeling. why the hell am i like this? i want to rant to someone but when i try to reach out nobody ever replies, and if they do they stop quickly. i know nobody loves me anymore. i know that im worth nobody’s time. my ex coming back for some damn reason only to make things so much worse is really making me loose it. what also doesn’t help is that today marks 5 months since i’ve lost a loved one who took their own life. i was doing okay until recently, and now i have so much anger i have thoughts of hurting myself, others and doing illegal things. i feel like a mix of not giving a shit about anything and at the same time caring too much. im a disaster.

this is so much to take in and handle. my head is killing me and i just wish i could cry but im so angry and upset at everything and everyone in this damn world that if i cry i’ll just get more angry at myself. im sorry for this post but i just had to rant somewhere.",mentalhealth,2021-01-22 16:10:58

It's raining outside. Everything is dark, and I was feeling very sad (my mood is often influenced by the weather). So, I associated the bad weather with a positive image: an ancient castle, a ghost story (I like these atmospheres!!) ... and... my mood changed! I was actually happy for living this rainy day! No effort, nothing delusional. It was an actual, spontaneous emotion. 

I tried again. I entered into a dark room. No light at all. I felt a bit afraid. I imagined: ""someone is trying to kill me, but he can't find me, because of this darkness"". I felt safe. My physical posture changed too. 

If you wish, try it! It works for me! Obviously, I guess it works if you have a good imagination, and your negative emotion isn't too much intense. But I think it's a good idea to develop and strengthen this power.",mentalhealth,2021-01-22 16:20:47

My chest has a hole inside of it, 

I have no choice but to voice this publicly

I’ve grieved and grieved far too much for one ducking lifetime, and my dumbass parents have no clue

My Body, skin has been damaged beyond recognition

My legs are contracted and I’m stuck in freeze mode and my upper back is completely constricted and tightened, from trauma response in childhood 

My brain is completely ducked up, and I cannot do anything properly, my vocabulary is a jumble

I’ve processed way too many repressed emotions, only to find out there’s a fuckload more

I’ve had to train for a year, before I burst out crying in the parking lot, after which I discovered the concept of repressed emotions for the first time

I’ve felt my stomach churn innumerable times when I tried to painfully lift weights, and feel the “energy” of the repressed emotions leave my body, only to figure out there’s more layers and more emotions (guilt, shame, fear, anger) 
That never saw the light of day in my childhood

This whole thing is a jumble, and a mess, but I can’t blame myself, because this is what trauma and damage does

How bout GFY mom and dad, you stupid ducks who care about some bullshit virus, and my CV ? And give my bullshit about “ you’re our only son, blah ducking blah, 

Lmao, I’m not even kidding, If I was in the us, I’d probably have fantasized about offing my dad with an equalizer

First of all, i'm 18, and i have my finals this year. In my country finals are something important, like, you get a diploma and u are seen higher in the society to say so.
My problem is that i have no motivation to study, I'm feeling down and stressed at all times, except when i'm out there driving, that's the one thing that keeps me going at the time.
I don't feel welcomed at home, i mean, i was extremely poor when i was a child, like i would search around the house with my dad for some change so we can buy bread, and that period teached me how to respect money and do not waste it (now, because of some extreme sacrifices that my parents  made we are an above average family, with some good savings and a nice apartment). So this is the third apartment that i lived in, and so far here i lived the longest period, though i still don't feel welcomed, like, idk, i argue with my dad almost everyday (he started drinking 2 years ago when my uncle (his brother) died, and we have some fights beacouse when he is drunk he is extremely arrogant and a bit of a duche), and he provokes me with things that i simply can't stay quiet about, and the relationship with my mom is often a good one, but sometimes she drinks too (not often, pretty rare if i do say so myself, and not in big quantities) but when she does drink, she makes me feel worthless, like idk, she has a way with words that make me feel like i'm just a burden for her. 
So in the end, i need an advice on how to get some motivation when the world seems to be against me, and i need an advice on what to do so i would feel more welcomed in my own house. Sorry for the long post and thank you 

Note: I was depressed since I was in 6th grade until 9th, i'm not happy now, but i can't say that i'm depressed, i'm just sad most of the time, idk how to explain it.

I'm a 30 yr old male that has had 3 anxiety attacks in the last 2 weeks.
I have never felt anything close to what I've felt in the last 2 weeks, I am new to this feeling of not being in control of my body. I have gone to the ER once last week and they did exams on my body, everything came out good, ekgs heart ultrasounds and blood samples, I'm writing this because I feel like me having covid in early Dec has me on the edge all the time, I have lost alot of people in my life because of this pandemic and I want to find a way to beat this feeling I have inside me, I want to be me again. I want to live my life without constantly thinking am I going to get covid again? Am I getting another attack?
I want to see if this community can help me out with ways of dealing with this  and what you guys do to get through anxiety/panic attacks.

What have I done the 3 times I get one?
I usually walk my dog around my block, take deep breaths, try to keep peace of mind.

My attacks have lasted from up to 30 min of hard anxiety and trying to calm myself down to 1 hour of lingering feelings of anxiety.

I have accepted that I have anxiety and believe that's a big first step that I have taken.",mentalhealth,2021-01-22 17:04:29

I’ve been experiencing this sick pit in my body, fatiqueness, deep heavy breathing every few mins, stress, anxiousness, nausea, headaches here and there, not being able to pretty do any of my activities or productive stuff I need to get done. I’ve been waking up during the night as well. I end up overthinking like what if I have a serious anxiety disorder now, what am I suppose to do my parents don’t believe in that sort of stuff, what if I tried a CBD pen, what if I’m just overreacting and just getting sick.


When I first felt like this it came out of nowhere, I tried asking myself if anything triggered this but nothing huge or serious, but from there I will say some other things came up like an argument with my dad that triggered memories that made me cry in a restaurant and harassment from some older guy talking about me in a sexual way just made things worse on top of it but it didn’t start any of these feelings. 

Maybe someone has some insight on what it is that I’m going through because it’s made me more anxious not knowing what’s wrong with me.

Obviously we change as we get older, but I WANT to do the things I used to do. I used to be a lot more productive with my time and had more hobbies and interests. As a teenager I used play guitar, read books/magazines, paint my nails, listen to records, collect gemstones, write in my diary, did a lot of baking, watched horror films, etc. Obviously some of these things I still do now and again, but a lot of these things feel like chores now. I'm 22 now and I often just go on social media on my phone or play video games now.  I genuinely don't even remember any of the songs I used to know on guitar as I have rarely played it the past 4 years. 

Like I said, I get that hobbies change with age. But these were things I was passionate about, things that defined me. I genuinely don't know how to define myself anymore. I have no hobbies. I have no interests. I just go on my phone. I can't even be bothered to watch TV or movies very often anymore. I don't even know if this is directly related to the mental hardships I've been through as I don't feel like I've been THAT traumatised. I have had on and off experiences with depression and anxiety/panic attacks in these past years, but I also went through a rough time as a teenager too. As a teenager I was bulimic, cut myself, had body dysmorphia, etc. So realistically I was probably worse off back then, yet I still enjoyed things. Now I don't, and it makes me sad as I feel like I've wasted my life a bit. I recognise that I'm probably romanticising the past a bit, but I do know for a fact that I did used to enjoy a lot of the things I used to do. I can barely be bothered to even paint my nails or do a face mask now. Everything feels like effort that results in no satisfaction. Is this just what growing up is? I haven't had any proper friends in the past 4 years either, as I left my hometown at 18 and only had 2 friends in my new city for a couple years, then only 1 friend, then nobody. I have a boyfriend now, but still no friends as I've moved city again. I do have 2 old friends from my hometown that I talk to regularly via text, but I do wonder if my lack of physical friendship may play a role this as I was still getting enjoyment out of things when I first moved to the city and had a couple friends.

I know it seems as easy as ""just start doing those things again!"" but every time I have picked up my guitar or a book I have become bored after like 5-10 minutes and just give up. I just want to feel REAL joy again, not just the instant gratification I get from my phone. Any advice?",mentalhealth,2021-01-22 17:51:03

This has bothered me for days because i obviously dont remember writing it, and its made me realize how long ive felt this way (33) and worried that it will now most likely be with me until i do eventually die.

I have never been involved with psychiatrists or professionals like this in my life and am overwhelmed. The psychiatrist I'll call Dr P a psychologist told me he is not sure my symptoms are anxiety or overstimulation on antidepressant or hyperactivity and unsure if I have ADHD. The psychiatrist wants me to come off the SSRI and see how I am off it, because I have this internal agitation and feel my blood pumping through my body when I take it and feel super edgy and impatient. He has told me to come off it and then let's review if we need to go back on one in two weeks or if we will try a stimulant for ADHD. He gave me a prescription for a few benzodiazepines to help withdrawal if needed. I havent been happy with the SSRI for a long time, because of the edgy agitated feeling on it and feeling this blood curdling feeling internally and this pressure in my hands that feel I could jump out of my skin, so I avoid people cause the stimulation feels worse around people like I could literally pounce on someone. I am also doing CBT every two weeks and feel I'm making headway with the social anxiety on that but the agitation is a huge issue that no amount of CBT could help, so I want to come off the SSRI. 

This is where it gets complicated. My sister is making this huge deal of what Dr P said and thinks it's extremely negligent and pressured me into making an appointment with a psychiatrist Dr A I went to months ago who I turned down his anxiety programme because he said I'd have to stay on the SSRI for years and the agitation is anxiety and didnt feel listened to. I told my CBT therapist I'm working with what my sister said and if I decide to do that programme 3 mornings a week he said I've to leave him, cause you cant do both. My sister is adamant what I have is severe anxiety and to do the programme and leave the CBT therapist and Dr P. My gut is telling me to cancel the appointment and not listen to my sister, even though she seems very sure this is what I need, I dont. The appointment with the psychiatrist Dr A that I'm not pushed to see or even do the anxiety programme I accidentally double booked with my CBT therapist. My sister says I better keep that appointment and go see him, and cancel the CBT guy. She is begging me to go to the anxiety group and go ahead with the appointment to the psychaitrist I didnt see eye to eye to and now I am stuck in a knot and need your opinion. Do I cancel the CBT appointment or the psychiatrist Dr A one that is double booked, I really want to go to my CBT appointment ? Do I do what my sister says and go ahead with the appointment and commit to the anxiety group or keep with the CBT? Do I go ahead and come off the SSRI that I agreed to with Dr P or do what my sister says and not do it and do the appointment with dr A. 

I feel the right thing to do is come off the SSRI with Dr P and either switch to an snri he says or else not take it any anymore if my moods ok and try a stimulant or see where I'm at in 2 weeks, go to the CBT appointment and email Dr A saying I'm switching medication so would like to postpone the appointment? I feel so unsure because my sister is pushing me strongly to do the opposite of what I want. If you were me what would you do?",mentalhealth,2021-01-22 17:58:59

As a kid I was always more sensitive to touch than other children. I was that child that complained about an itchy blanket, who was extremely picky about clothing material and fit.  My mother commented on it often, and I couldn’t understand how my sisters were so okay wearing the things they did. Maybe they weren’t. Maybe I was just the only one to vocalize my discomfort.

	I struggled with school. From 2nd grade on I had chronic nausea/stomach aches that the doctor said was probably just from stress. I couldn’t seem to get my brain to grasp onto what I was trying to learn. Doing homework felt like trying to grab an ice cube off a slippery counter with numb fingers and your eyes closed. To this day, homework (I'm in college) still causes a rising internal chaos of frustration, burning and grinding and exploding from my belly into my chest until I burst into tears or screams, the urge to jump and stomp my feet, NEEDING to get this terrible feeling out of my body.

	I have extremely difficult time keeping my brain on track when I find a subject boring. This does NOT happen at work, where my urge to perform perfectly for my employer (due to my overwhelming need to make everyone love me) overrides any other need I might feel. In 5 years of work I have missed less than a week of scheduled work time, and those are only when I was very sick. I always perform at 100% because the idea of someone being even mildly displeased with me makes me sick to my very core. But at home, when I’m trying to study for school, it’s nearly impossible to keep focused. Homework that should take me an hour to complete will take all day because I don’t want to even start since I know the dirty, prickly feeling in my stomach will return, and because once I start I find my mind drifting. It’s difficult to study for more than 15 minutes at a time and when I return to my study I find I barely remember what I read.

	I have a lot of interests, and when I want to research those interests I can literally do it all day long. In fact, it pretty much always blocks out any other responsibilities I have. I already struggle with motivating myself to do chores, even when I’m not hyper-fixated on something. Feeding, cleaning, and caring for my children are the only things that can break me out of my stare-at-my-phone-for-hours funk, and my addiction to my phone has gotten out of hand.

	I struggle incredibly with depression and anxiety. Everything makes me anxious. Even nothing can make me anxious- the anxiety is always there, eating away at my insides at every moment. It wasn’t always bad, and for years I didn’t even identify that the funny feeling I carried was anxiety. But the last few years, especially since having children, it’s been tearing me apart. The constant noise that comes with having two young boys overstimulates me and leaves me feeling like I’m vibrating with negative energy. With no exaggeration, I am overstimulated EVERY day (and most of the day) for the last year. Sounds, smells, and visual stimuli all overstimulate me and even cooking dinner while my husband tries to have a conversation can send me into an overstimulated meltdown. This causes my anger to rise. I’m not sure where my anger comes from, but I think it's always been there. I think it was just a lot easier to keep under control before having kids. The overstimulation definitely exacerbates the anger, though. That sick feeling of frustration that is so similar to what I feel while studying lives with me, always under the surface, ready to explode at any minor inconvenience or loud sound.

	A few months ago a therapist told me it sounds like I might have PTSD. I am diagnosed with Major Depression and Generalized Anxiety Disorder. Perhaps she was right. Perhaps my mother’s absence when she chronically escaped to bed combined with my father’s combustive (and oftentimes borderline abusive) personality created trauma for my sensitive little soul. Or perhaps behavioral issues from never learning how to properly function as a human due to the lack of training from my absentee parents has combined with my anxiety to create the mess you currently see. Or maybe that psychiatrist was right when he told a 10 year-old me that I had a mild form of ADHD. But when I look at the description of ADHD people, I don’t identify with it. If you spoke with me or watched me you would not think I have ADHD. When I need to, I can function. My house might be messy but once I muster the motivation to clean, I don’t have a hard time focusing on it. In fact, I like it. If it’s between dealing with my noisy and chaotic children, studying, or cleaning, I will clean every time.

	It truly seems to be an issue of motivation. If I’m not motivated to do it, I get anxiety about doing it. Do I dread homework because I associate it with feelings of frustration because I didn’t know how to study as a child and now that association triggers an anxiety response? Do I dread homework because I’m lazy and would rather watch TikToks? Do I dread homework because my need to be perfect at everything I do makes studying difficult because it forces me to realize I don’t naturally know everything and it causes cognitive dissonance? Or do I dread homework because I have ADHD and my brain literally shuts down when I look at something I’m uninterested in?

	My kids need attention. I can’t handle being in their noisy presence. I love them desperately and want to give them a good life, which starts with - ya know, actually playing with them. But something about their presence triggers anger, anxiety, frustration, and oftentimes tears. I worry that I’ll never get better and that I’ll ruin my children in a similar way that my parents “ruined” me. I know they didn’t ruin me, but a lot of the things I struggle with seem to come from what they did or didn’t teach me as a child. Nobody taught me how to have self-control or self-discipline. My mom slept all day and my dad either stared at the tv after work or yelled at us kids. Somehow I am both of my parents in the way I treat my own children. It’s a very disorienting sensation to realize you have become your parents.

	Why did becoming a mom trigger all these issues? They were always there, but I managed them. I could manage. I can no longer manage. Increasingly I think my kids would be better off with a new mom, while I hang out at a mental institute until l die. Then they won’t get yelled at or locked in their room while I cry out of frustration. Then they would have someone to teach them and nurture them. But then I think that’s just me trying to get the easy way out. Instead of giving them someone better, why can’t I just BE BETTER? And I try. But I feel stuck in my feelings, unable to move, unable to get a grip. My marriage is failing, my children are being ruined, I deeply dislike myself, and here I sit, unable to make a change, feeling like I’m suffocating, time ticking and failing more and more every day.

	I tell myself, “Just do it! Just get up and take the kids for a walk! Just be nicer to them! Just take care of yourself so you don’t spiral like this!” My husband tells me, “Just TRY exercise! I PROMISE it will help!” And he’s right. It would help. There’s no real reason I should not be able to simply get up right now and go for a walk. But it feels like I'm standing on the ledge of a bridge with someone yelling “JUST JUMP!” Even if I knew it would help and be good for me, there is simply no way I would be able to jump or step off. That's the sensation I sit with every day. “Just do it.” But I can’t. I don’t know why I can’t.

  I deeply dislike the person I've become. I feel selfish, lazy, and disgusted. I've gained weight and hate looking in the mirror. When I tell at my kids I can see them die a little bit inside, not understanding why mommy is so angry, and wondering what they did wrong to receive such a reaction. I am traumatizing them. And I can't stop. I love them and I hate myself and maybe I should just go hide in the woods forever.",mentalhealth,2021-01-22 18:10:39

Also on mobile, so, sorry for formatting, blah blah blah, etc. 

My basic question/tldr is: How to help someone, an adult, who does not want help, yet says they want to feel better and are sick of feeling “like this” ? 

So, I’m 22F, I still live at home with my mom(54F) and my brother, (25M) also still lives at home. 

My brother and I both suffer with depression and anxiety, but my brother’s been in a really bad place for a long while and refuses to seek any kind of treatment. 

Not only is this a major detriment to his own life, it’s also made life hell for my mom and I. He’ll often become verbally abusive, he’ll yell and scream and damage things. He doesn’t shower, or clean up after himself. 

I know he’s in severe need of help. He’ll often have outbursts, either of anger, or sobbing, or both. And he’ll express that he doesn’t want to live like this, and that he doesn’t know what to do, but refuses the idea of talking to any professional, reaching out to anyone, or trying anything at all. 

His room hasn’t been cleaned in years. My mom and I constantly ask him to, I’ve offered to help him clean it, my mom has offered to hire professionals to help. We try to be pleasant and helpful and not coming at him from a blaming “omg you suck, clean your room” type standpoint. His room has gotten so bad, the whole room is basically a pile of garbage, and he has to squeeze his way through the door. I don’t think either me or my mom can fit through the door anymore. 

He’ll take dishes and cutlery up to his room, and they’ll usually get lost in the garbage pile. Now my mom and I hide a few plates, bowls and cutlery so that my brother doesn’t take them and lose them. 

He’s had a couple of jobs through the years but due to both depression and severe insomnia he can’t keep them. He does receive disability due to diagnosed sleep issues, and he does pay a portion of the bills. He never leaves the house other than to the store (and that was true long before Covid) 

I know he’s depressed and severely needs help. My mom and I have suggested getting help in several different ways, both on his good days and his bad days, and he’ll either become angry and refuse or just casually brush it off and say he doesn’t need help. 

He’s also addicted to the over-the-counter allergy meds. The angry outbursts have been a problem before he was ever doing the drugs, but I do think they’ve worsened it, and obviously I’m sure it’s extremely destructive to his body, and Im constantly worried about that. 

He’ll complain about physical aches and pains a lot, yet never ever seeks medical care. We do have a family doctor, and we’re Canadian so it’s free for him to book an appointment, but he’s adamant that it won’t do anything to help him. 

I also really hate the way he treats my mom (the way he treats me too, but especially our mom) He’ll get so angry and yell and call her awful things over nothing, and he never cleans up the house even though my mom and I both work. My mom comes home from work to find his empty food wrappers all over the kitchen (except for days I’m home first to clean it up)

I know he’s depressed and needs help. Some days Im so frustrated I feel like I hate him, but also I do believe that he’s a good guy, and I love him and just know he needs help. But he refuses to get it and I don’t know how to make him. 

He’ll yell and scream, often these contain phrases claiming he’s going to hurt or kill himself, although he’s never had an actual attempt. Other times he’ll just get angry and lash out at me or my mom for seemingly nothing. 

I know my mom (and myself) are enabling him at this point, but we don’t really know how to deal with it. 

I know someone needs to want help in order to accept the help, but I don’t know how to get him to want the help. He says “he doesn’t want to feel like this” but won’t take steps to changing that. 

I’m frustrated, worried, scared and have no idea what to do. Thanks for reading this long-ass post, and thanks in advance for any potential advice.",mentalhealth,2021-01-22 18:14:34

Over the past two years, I feel that my personality is divided into pieces. I act and feel completely different sometimes. I feel that I am losing the control of number of personalities I have. This happens most when I am writing my thoughts. My thoughts shift to different personality types and moods all the time. For example, I have a part of me that loves studying so much and I can't stop myself from studying. Sometimes I feel I hug myself, sometimes I feel like I am married with myself. Sometimes I try to control the switch but sometimes I lose it. It is not like I have different voices in me talking but I feel the fight between different personalities when I do hard choices. This started to happen so often that I started calling myself ""we/us"" these days without noticing. I am not so worried about this and it is not affecting me badly. I like having them as a part of mine.

I understand that everyday is filled with lots of tasks at hand. I understand that everyday we **CAN'T** do everything but we can certainly do our best with the energy we have today. Some things will take some time to plan, to work itself out. Have the intention of doing 1 thing towards whatever it is you want to start, **today.** 

Once we begin doing 1 thing a day towards our passions, our craft, our mental health, exercising, meditating etc., then naturally we will continue to do more of it daily, where ""I don't have time for that"", will turn into ""I need to do this for myself"" and things that have no value, like scrolling aimlessly on social media, continuously having conversations with people that trigger anger, trauma etc., will decrease. **It is all ok. It is all valid.**

Over the past 36 months its been a total reshape and realignment of my life, as I know it has been for you as well. We live day to day with so much pressure sometimes on ""doing more"", on ""not doing enough""; that we forget and push to the side, how much has already **been done**, even in 3 years. You might say ""wow, 3 years is a long time"" or ""wow, 3 years is no time"", but **stop** for a moment and think. Think about where you were last January and how you felt? After a few moments of experiences and feelings coming up, think about where you were the January before that? Breathe and feel who you were, what you were doing, who you were. Now, take a moment and try and think about the January before that? Feels like a long time ago right? Who were you? Do you know that person anymore? **Now,** isn't it beautiful on who we are **right now. Together, Separately.** 

We sometimes forget how much we have grown. We forget because of we are so focused on how we feel **right now,** which don't get me wrong, is valid, but sometimes when we overthink, try to make the future come to us, **we miss what is happening right now, which is most important.**

**Today:** Be kind to yourself. Be Gentle. Give yourself ease. You have come a long way to get to who you are, **right here, right now. I celebrate you,** even if I don't physically know you, **we are all connected.** I wish you well today.

**I love you.**

I'm diagnosed with generalised anxiety, social anxiety, PTSD, ADD, symptoms of OCD and I am on the high functioning end of the autism spectrum. 

Lately I've been having very dark thoughts of doing very bad violent things to other people. Unspeakable things. I can't seem to figure out if they're intrusive thoughts or fantasies. I don't know what's causing them. I had thoughts like these when I was younger, but I was able to power through them and push them aside. Now that I'm older it seems different. I don't have the same conviction as when I was younger and it scares me.

Hi, I (19F) speak about 5 languages. My second is the language of the country I grew up in (let’s say Spanish). So when I was little, I went to a Spanish speaking school. I was bullied in many different ways over the course of a few years. I’ve made a lot of progress since then thanks to therapy but I can’t help but notice how my personnality is completely different when I’m speaking Spanish.
I’ve read a couple of articles about how a person’s personnality can vary slightly depending on the language they are speaking.
When I speak any other language, I’m confident, outgoing, smart and I find it much easier to get my point through. I feel that’s when my character really shines through. 
When I speak Spanish, I’m shy, I stumble over my words and have trouble expressing myself.

Can it be a real thing? As in had I gone so used to being shunned with the use of this language, that I’m now afraid of expressing myself in it? 
Has anyone ever come across a similar situation.
I would like to have it sorted out though... I’m staying here for a good while it seems",mentalhealth,2021-01-22 18:47:31

Everyone is well aware that they’re not the best when it comes to these services but I genuinely feel like my doctor either doesn’t care or really wants to avoid any extra paperwork.

I’ve been receiving treatment for depression for about 6 months (it would’ve been longer, but they shrugged me off the first time I made an appointment for help). My doctor, who I though was great at first for actually listening, no longer listens. As soon as I answer his questions he’ll try to make it my symptoms seem less serious. For example I’ll say something like “I’ve been having breakdowns semi-regularly even at work and feel really low lately” and he’ll reply with “oh so just same as usual”. Now this wouldn’t be bad  if he didn’t say the exact thing every week since the week my phq-9 came back as “mild” when he toned down my answers. He doesn’t even bother to ask if I have any thoughts of suicide any more because of the one time I answered “no”. I literally have them every single day and I feel like even the one person who is literally paid to care, can’t be bothered.

So today I told him about the hallucinations I have been experiencing a lot lately and he just says “oh what of” and then just completely ignored it. We only speak over the phone but you can hear when he types stuff down that I’ve said, but there was no typing! 

I’m probably over thinking this but should I swap GPs? Like I also would like to see a specialist, but I feel like he’ll never send me to one. So yeah, I feel like I’m gonna wind up in hospital before I receive any real help.",mentalhealth,2021-01-22 18:48:16

&amp;#x200B;

So as of recently, my significant other and I have been talking a lot about sex and whatnot, and things of the sort. She'll tease me and do things like flash me and whatnot over video calls. But whenever she does this, I don't really feel anything. Like at all. You would think me being the male I am, the sight of breasts would excite me, but no. Inside I just think ""yeah, those are boobs :/"".

Now don't get me wrong. I love this person with all my heart. I truly do. This person means a lot to me and whenever we spend time with each other in person, it's a day worth remembering. So I don't believe this has anything to do with my love towards her.

I guess I could add this too... I have a history with pornographic material. I was exposed to this kind of material at an early age, and unfortunately, I've kinda grown up with it. I feel that this is the reason why I feel so desensitized. Why I feel so.. ""meh""

I'm not really sure what else to say, but this is how I've been feeling lately and it really troubles me because I want to show this person my love and all that. I don't want them to think I feel any less of them or anything like that. 

What should I do? How can I help myself improve on this?

Hi,  so this is my first time talking in here.  I've been kind of working up to say something. But I just went through a  break up with my girlfriend of 3 years. In those 3 years I got to  experience so much I've never gotten to before, I got to travel, go to  Disneyland for the first time in my LIFE! (at 21 years old), eat at some  amazing restaurants, we go 2 dogs and a cat together, we had plans to  get our own place, and I got to experience love for the first time. But  one day back in November before my birthday she told me she needed some  space and wanted to take a break. 2 weeks later, the day after my  birthday we broke up.

After  breaking up thinks were interesting to say the least. I had to move in  with her and her parents after leaving my lease at the house I was  living in. I was in a weird mental state of course because not many  people have to live with their ex and her parents after a break up. But  she was sure we'd be fine because in the end we were best friends.  Slowly I began resetting back to a relationship mindset and began  gaining needy and obsessive tendencies. I would check her location when  she went out and would check her phone everyone now and again until I  saw something I wanted to confront her about. After the confrontation  she told me it was okay and that's she's happy I did. But a day later  changed her passcode. But in hindsight I know I made a mistake looking  through her stuff and her location. I shouldn't have and it was wrong.  But again I was in a relationship mindset still although a toxic one at  that.

Later on I moved out and  back in with my parents. Today I just had a talk with her over text and  found she wanted to break up for some time now. I realized it because of  some tendencies that'd happen. She'd ask me on occasion whether or not I  thought we looked good together and what I'd do if we broke up. I  didn't read into it at the time and just assumed it was just a quirk and  brushed it off. But today is different. After talking I realized lies  that were there and that things weren't going to be okay.

I'm broken. I'm shattered. I'm scared.

If anyone has any advice I'd appreciate it. Its my first time having to recover from someone I genuinely loved.",mentalhealth,2021-01-22 19:00:20

When I was younger &amp; got in serious situations (cops pulling over high schoolers smoking weed), I’d have to hold myself back from laughing. It wasn’t that I didn’t take these events seriously. I would be extremely scared but I wouldn’t have the same quiet reactions of my friends.

Recently, it has been happening when I view articles of tragedies. I frankly find it disgusting of myself &amp; am so embarrassed of my reaction. What is wrong with me? 

At the same time, I believe myself to be an extremely empathetic person. How I may have reacted at other times for posts that both directly impacted me or were in far off countries, would be by crying. I’ve had a few posts shake me to the core &amp; leave me feeling like I’ve been punched in the gut. I don’t think i’m a sociopath &amp; truly believe I’d try to help if I could. For example, as I’ve read more &amp; more about adopted youths struggles, I’ve decided to make a tiny change &amp; adopt in the future if I can.


I notice that I have the same issue every time. My brain almost doesn’t want to comprehend what is going on. Because the reactions feel so wrong, I’ll force myself to think harder about what I’m seeing, but I almost feel a mental block when it comes to that. Like re-reading a sentence over &amp; over without realizing what it’s saying. 

WHAT IS WRONG WITH ME? Is this a sign of some type of disorder? I am in my mid-twenties. How can I compose myself &amp; stop reacting this way?? Or stop whatever is going on?

Like i said, in my core, I don’t feel any malice or joy from these things. I even exit out of what I’m seeing to try to forget it...but that’s wrong too...to turn a blind eye to people’s struggles.


P.S. I’m not sure if this is correlated but I also remember having wrong reactions as a child. A teacher asked me to stay after school to help with my homework &amp; after being embarrassed, she’d reassure me how it was okay. My reaction? I could not stop crying the whole session &amp; she never had one with me again.",mentalhealth,2021-01-22 19:01:47

I have friends and family, but none are on the same wavelength as me. There is no one in my life to admire, no one to have discussions with and help elevate each other. It’s always me trying to explain or justify my ideals and being met with dismissal. I’m having to lift others up, but they often don’t even want to accept that there’s anywhere higher to go. All I can do is listen to pre-recorded podcasts to elevate my mind and broaden my horizons, often replying to the hosts in my thoughts, or just having internal monologues.

I feel like I can’t truly connect with anybody. There’s always this disparity between me and everyone I know. I’m having to constantly ignore little close-minded statements here and there; pretend I didn’t hear it. It doesn’t work. 

I feel like an outcast in my community. A couple of times, when I tried to have a conversation in a public space with a friend, I was gestured to “keep my voice down” because they presumed that what I said was controversial or something. They acted as if I was saying something embarrassing. As if I was saying something I wasn’t supposed to say, thinking too much...

I’m lonely when I’m around friends and family, and I know they’re not going to change. I want to meet someone that I can truly connect with, but it might be hopeless in my close-minded community.

Also I'll be posting this on multiple subreddits because I dont know what the right sub would be for my post, and to possibly get more people's perspectives. Thank you for reading in advance, I really appreciate it.

So during my last therapy session me and my therapist talked about my relationship with my family. I told her about the rollarcoaster that is my mother and my dads relationship is, (I literally dont know if they are married or not because they argued so much about handing in the divorce papers and it seemed like they did it like 3-5 times that I literally dont know whats up with them) and about the abuse I went through because of them. Both physical and mental. I dont want to share the worst things but its probably worse than what you would think of. While telling her about the abuse, I could only smile and laugh, i dont know why, i found it weird having to talk about this, since i think its normal and that i had deserve these, and now i have to talk about it like its a problem. After i finished she was close to crying i could see in her eyes and in her voice. Which really made me think if all of this okay. 

One of my earliest memories relating them was me having to plan a city at a child therapist (around age 8) and tell her where things are and why. I had placed a house somewhere and 5 other houses where my friends lived. I placed my family far away, on the other side of the city, where ive been asked why i made this decision but i couldnt answer. I was never close to my family and found my friends more important. I barely invited my friends over because of their arguments because it always made me embarassed. I was jealous of my friends for having good families and for them being close with them. But i didnt want it with my own. I dont like my family and honestly think its dysfunctional, my mom tries to love me but i dont let her, I dont want her to love me, after all that she did to me that affected me growing up. I'm keeping my distance. It's hard to forgive her for telling a 6 year old how he was a mistake and she doesnt want me and will send me to an orphanage, and how he should not have been born. So I dont want to let them close. 

Ever since I can remember, I was always against myself. I pretty much always had depression. And I blame my family for everything thats wrong with me mentally. I'm my own enemy and I accepted that I received this abuse because I deserved it, I always see myself as the victim that deserves everything happening to him (even a 6 year old getting wooden spoons broken in half on his back and all the ""I never wanted you, I loved you so much but youre such a disappointment""'s i had to listen to, as funny as it sounds)

Sometimes I try to think of why i feel this way towards my family, my mom tried to protect me, and did some good things but I just cant get these out of my head, I try to justify if they deserve the way i see them but i just cant wrap my head around this and all the emotional blackmail im getting from them. 

I always have a big ""I dont know"" in my head whenever people ask me how I am, or I try to think of who I am, nothing comes out other than ""I dont know"". I remember telling my ex girlfriend about my family situation, and I remember how she told me ""I'm so proud of you for being such a good person even after how your family treats you"" which made me want to cry back then and it does right now too, am i really a victim? I always accepted this and saw this as OK. My therapist told me how sad this story makes her because theres so much value in me but its dampened because of my family. 

I was always passively suicidal and against myself as i said, I always justified and accepted everything happening to me. I was always pretty unhappy with everything, which i always got the ""Why are you always so unhappy"" treatment for. I'm pretty sure I always had depression, but the big ""I dont know"" is there in my head again, it just feels so natural that I dont even know if i have it, im just so unsure, its been there for so long that I cant see a difference of when I was OK and my current situation, I just cant decide if theres something really wrong with me.

Every day i find myself randomly wanting to cut myself, I don't know why i just want to cut myself to pieces but i mostly end up not doing it because im too lazy. I feel so broken and like I'll never be fixed. I hope i wont reach my next birthday. I feel so lonely and wish i had someone to love and support me, other than my therapist, i miss my girlfriend so so much she was the only reason i was happy and the only person who supported me in everything and i just miss it so much, i want someone to help me, i wish i wasnt so affraid to lose her, i wish she missed me, I wish I didn't lose her, wish i could make things better or that she just talked to me. I cant wait to turn 18 and ruin my life however i want. Ive been so tired all day lately, the only thing i want to do is be alone, like move to mountain where im alone and i cant bother anyone. I genuenly don't know who I am.

Is it as bad as i see it by other people's responses? Am i like this because of my family? Are my emotions real? My mom still hugs me and stuff but I never feel anything I just let her do her thing and i don't reciprocate. Is this okay? Do i deserve to be happy? Was i really abused? Can someone relate? Will i ever get better? How should i feel about my family and proceed about this? Will i get out of this, am i a victim? i have these and so many other questions in my head. 

Im sorry this post is so all over the place, i really dont know where i was going with it and i want to see what people think. Its a long read and i thank you for reading this i really appreciate it. Not going to lie i really feel stupid about this post and i feel like i made myself look stupid and embarrassing but I'll try to get over it and still post it. Thank you.",mentalhealth,2021-01-22 19:25:22

It was always what i considered my dream job , but It ruined my mental health. I had so many break downs and was suicidal from day one. I had a mindset of just keep pushing through that things would get better over time. I made it my mission to improve. Almost to the point of obsession to try and be perfect. I became an ideal employee, but I was depressed on the inside. The job is stressful on it’s own. Having to meet tight deadlines every single day and dealing a lot with the public which can be overwhelming at times. On top of that there’s little concern for employees. There’s a bully like culture from management and also little concern for safety. Sometimes we have to go in bad neighborhoods alone. I was suicidal for years and while my tolerance to the toxic work culture has grown strong, I still have moments. 


I live paycheck to paycheck. I wanted to start a savings and thought moving in with my parents would help. My dad looked and talked to me like I was a huge disappointment. He made a comment saying at almost 30 years old I would’ve expected you to do better. What will you do when I die. 

I really understand that and don’t take my family or their help for granted, but hearing him say that just crushed me.

He even brought  up how he was able to take care of a family when he was  18 years old but he doesn’t understand that the world is different now. He grew up in a small town years ago. Cost of living wasn’t like how it is now.

I’ve picked up another job to help with some funds but it’s still not enough to help me create a savings. Which I know I need if I plan on leaving my job soon. 

At one point my dad saw me struggling and said he’d help me pay my rent. Which Im grateful for but absolutely hate having to rely on him for that. It hurts me to my core knowing I can’t be fully financially dependent. It hurts me and makes me feel like I’m a burden to him. 

He helps me pay half but there are times when he will give me the money late, which puts me in a bind when I’m trying to ration out which paycheck will be used on bills. It helps and I’m grateful for it, but I thought me moving in would just help the both of us.

I decided to quit my job in 5  months. We are contract workers so my contract ends around that time. I rather not re-sign another contract and stay for 2or 3 more years. Hell i feel like I can’t even stay a few more months.

I tried to see if I could move back home just for that time but my dad again made me feel like a failure. It’s really hurtful . I feel stuck. It’s like I’m an adult but just don’t know how to get myself out of this situation. I just turned 29 and have  been deeply depressed. When my dad says those things to me it just weighs me down even more. I’ve never been someone who mooches off of my parents. I only go to them when I really need the help. When my dad throws in my face that I should be doing better in life  it just spirals me down a suicidal path, where I don’t know what’s the point of living anymore if I can’t be successful or happy or anymore.",mentalhealth,2021-01-22 19:47:08

Things were WAY more dramatic this second time than they were the first time. I won't get into details, but it resulted in injury, I did end up in the regular hospital, was transferred to their psych ward and then transferred to the psych hospital they're affiliated with.

I was in the hospitals from Monday-Friday last week and all I can say is the mental health system here fucking sucks. I currently am on state insurance due to going back to school and not working full time, it isn't exactly going to get me a ticket to a swanky hospital in my state. However, what I dealt with was like scary. I've never had a psych ward experience, so I would almost like to see if anyone can draw parallels? 

At the regular hospital psych floor before I was transferred, I was in basically a pod. There were about 6 of them, all plastic rooms with a bed, then a shared tv and bathroom. Basically like jail. All everyone did was sleep, we literally had 0 resources to talk to anyone and they never even woke us up to eat. I had a couple of bites the entire time I was there. While I fought with them about transferring me and I just wanted to be signed out I was relieved to finally get some sort of help, but that also fell short.

The people were from all walks of life, some were very unwell and unsafe to even be around. We were basically left to do our own thing with group therapy 2 x a day and a quick check in w a dr, about 5 mins. I was able to tell them what meds I was on and what I wanted without them checking anything, in hindsight I should have lied. We ate meals in our room due to covid, and like literally were just on our own all day long. I'm not sure how group therapy twice a day of 30 mins at a time would be helpful when there's 10 people in the group. Anyway, I fought tooth and nail to get out and I did before the weekend, thank god.

So here I am again, second failed attempt having to deal with how people treat me in the aftermath.  I don't feel like anyone should be nice to me and I'm having a really hard time accepting people's generosity and concern. I have a friend who was nice enough to let me stay with her and her family while I navigate getting a bit better and I just feel so guilty about it all. People are being SO nice and I just feel so uncomfortable. It's clearly also time to get back in therapy, but how do I even start with someone new and open up with this? My mind is still fucked up and I never want to be sent away again that was such a terrible experience all around. I just hate the mental health system and I wish there was a way I could get appropriate care but it just doesn't seem possible and I feel like my brain will be broken forever, so what's the point in trying?",mentalhealth,2021-01-22 19:49:36

I don't know why, and thought someone might have some insight.

Just as the title says. I don't know if obsession is the right word though... More like, it brings me great satisfaction. I used to think of it as an adrenalin rush sort of thing. ""The risk of being caught."" I'm a sober addict and adrenalin is something like a drug to me, so I guess that always made sense. Lately, however, I've been starting to think differently. Before it was primarily rule breaking. Stealing from stores, sneaking out, etc. Now it's breaking unwritten rules. For example, me and my family like to debate alot, almost like sport. I find myself picking the opposition on many topics, even when talking to people outside of my family, just to make them question their own beliefs. And with porn. I find myself looking at things I definantly don't believe in because the excitement of breaking my own moral boundaries is overwhelming. For example, I'm a straight guy, but sometimes look at gay porn because it's ""wrong."" Not saying that it's wrong to be gay or anything, I support the LGBT movement, that's just not who I am. There are many other examples if needed. I guess what I really mean to say is I really really like doing things I'm not supposed to. Like, nothing's beats it. I've searched around on the web and I haven't found anything about people like me. I don't know why I'm like this, but I thought I might share.

Last year, I lost almost all my friends, I was really young at the time, in my early teen years... This all started when I got in my first relationship with one of the boys in the group which was 2 years ago.
I was really dumb at the time but I mostly went in a relationship with him because I felt like I was forced to, he really wanted a girlfriend and his friends weren't that nice to him so I felt really bad because he told me he was depressed. I went in to a relationship with him and he seemed much happier and he'd be really kind to me. But then when we started hanging out at my house... He got excited and he did terrible things to me that I can't forget, it was mostly sexual stuff but it wasn't anything too bad, he mostly would just touch me inappropriately which I didn't really like. This relationship eventually spiralled downhill and he'd do even worse things and he'd embarass me in public, he'd say embarassing things about me to his friends. He stopped being the kind person he was and he's get mad at me if I didn't listen to him, this ended up in a lot of fights and I remember crying a lot. I broke up with him because I finally realised that this relationship was wrong because I had been put through so much sadness and discomfort that I had enough. I didn't break up with him before because I felt like if I did I'd have no one else, I didn't have many friends at the time. this ended up in a drama and he started hating me and blaming me because he said I broke up at the worst time, which I'm pretty sure he just made up to make me feel terrible. 
That's not the only thing that happened in 2019 though... During my relationship with that guy, i still had a best friend, but then my own best friend was being not a very nice person. I had been with my best friend ever since primary school, except lately she's been jealous of me. She didn't have a boyfriend and this upset her, because she really wanted one. She was incredibly jealous of me when I was in a relationship, so she tried making her crush love her. She caused a huge drama where she was just trying to force this innocent person to love her, but he was kind of shy and wasn't ready for that, he felt very uncomfortable. She dragged me in the drama by trying to convince him to be her friend, which honestly just ruined my reputation. Finally, she gave up but then she made an online boyfriend like some months later. She was so happy to be with this boyfriend even though he was young and was going through puberty, he was really mean and got really moody and caused lots of drama. Then, all of a sudden, this boyfriend of hers started bullying me online which I couldn't handle because I was already being mistreated by my boyfriend, and I was also being bullied at that time because I was defending my boyfriend who was getting builled. The bullying from her boyfriend really hurt, but the things he said were some of the things I only told my best friend. This made me start hating my best friend so I started avoiding her. 

Eventually, 2019 ended, but the infamous 2020 began. This was when most of my happiness deteriorated. In January I broke up with that terrible boyfriend but then I started hanging out with my boyfriend's friends because they started being nice and they were happy I broke up with him. I was so happy because I finally felt apart of something. We still had a little bit of drama but it was all ok. Until someone returned to the friend group, the person who hated my ex and me more than anything. This person convinced everyone I was a terrible person and a terrible moderator (all this conversations were in a discord server, I didn't really talk to them irl, I'd just hang out with them but I didn't really say anything because I'm socially anxious.)  He convinced everyone I was a terrible moderator because I was doing my job when people were being rude to eachother. I made sure everyone followed the rules and I actually did stuff when someone broke the rules, unlike all the other mods who didn't want to start any drama/were lazy. This eventually ended up in everyone bullying me, including my ex. It got so bad, I felt like I had lost all my friends and my best friend. It was so terrible, I felt so depressed and I felt really unsafe. I left the server.

I still had one person though... One of the people in that group believed that I didn't do anything wrong and that I had just been through so much. He is stills my friend to this day, and eventually he became my boyfriend but I just, can't forget all that drama that happened. I still feel like I don't really have anyone and I miss the times when my enemies were friends.

Sorry for the really long post but thank you for reading, I feel a bit better because I wrote everything that was on my mind. It's now 2021, so I hope that I can finally push the past behind me and become a happier person. I think that all that's happened has made me into a self conscious person with low self-esteem but I really want to fix that. Again, thanks for reading, I appreciate it.",mentalhealth,2021-01-22 20:10:57

I don’t normally disclose my personal life online, and I am generally a very private person who does not reach out for support on personal matters (I usually reserve it for my therapist), but I am not able to see her for a few days.

I am just wondering if anyone else has ever dealt with a similar situation and how they got through it.

I don’t want to get into too many details here, but last night, I found out that my ex-boyfriend was violently murdered a couple of years ago. We are gay, if that matters. He was murdered by the boyfriend he had after me in a very violent and vicious manner.

I carry tremendous guilt based on some of the things I said to him during heated arguments and the fact that I blocked him from contacting me when he wanted to continue being in my life after we broke up (complicated story). One of the last things he said to me was that I must hate him because I was blocking him. I didn’t hate him, quite the opposite, but I knew if we continued speaking it would devolve into an unhealthy situation like it did many times before in the past. I thought it was best that we went our separate ways.

Of course, there’s much more to all of this, but the general gist of it is that I feel like if I had stayed with him and worked things out he wouldn’t have been killed or if I had kept talking to him as a friend after we broke up I could have at least helped warn him of red flags with his new boyfriend who killed him.

I can’t stop imagining his violent murder in vivid detail (many details of which I read in news reports) and it rips my heart out to think of somebody I loved fighting for his life and having such horrible pain and last moments on this earth. I wish I was there to protect him and keep him safe. I feel I should have been there for him.

He had many problems, and he was by no means perfect, but there was a lot of goodness in him. He worked in a selfless profession, giving up money to make a difference. He was only in his very early 30s when he was killed and had his whole life left to live.

I can’t even visit him in the cemetery because he’s buried so far away. I’m not religious, but I said a prayer directly to him with my thoughts and feelings as a last ditch effort to let him know I did love him and that I’m sorry if anything I did or said led to his death in an indirect way.

I would appreciate any input from anyone who has dealt with a situation like this. Please know that I will not comment any more details in public comments as I am very private. It is hard for me to even post this publicly. Please direct message me instead if possible.",mentalhealth,2021-01-22 20:11:15

I'm scared of public transport (even though I used to use it all the time when i was living in a capital city), I'm scared of getting a taxi alone, I'm scared of going to uni abroad, I am scared of doing anything alone and i think about death all the time. 

I do not know what has happened to me, but I am sick of what I have become. This is not me. I am embarrassed. I cannot live with this anxiety. I live in fear and it is dictating my life and holding me back. Does anyone have any advice??",mentalhealth,2021-01-22 20:41:57

Whoever you are, whatever your age is, whatever you believe, whatever your gender indentity is. Your perception of yourself, your qualities and your flaws, even for the most over-analysers among you, is flawed. You will never be perceived exactly the way you perceive yourself to be. 

If you were bullied for how you look, believe me you don't look as horrid as people want to make you think you do.

If you were isolated because of how you behaved, believe me, someone will have done weirder and not gotten any shit about it. 

For those who got abandonned because of mental illness, disease, or anything else. If you look hard enough, or even if you don't look for it, there exist someone who will befriend you and care for you. Maybe not in the way you fantasized about but they exist nonetheless.  


To everyone that has, do, or will struggle with mental illnesses in their life. You may not be living though a good time in your life, or maybe you are but dark thoughts keep creeping in. But you are valuable people. Don't fear seeking help, there is nothing shameful about that, even if right now you are feeling okay, after all the blacksmith doesn't always strike the metal when it's hot, they also strike it cold.   
Working on your issues even when you are not actively struggling with them is a good thing. Don't forget to rest, to drink, take a bath or a shower, or find anything that can allow you to relax a little. Self-care is important.

The low periods seem to be quite sporadic, or maybe I just can't find what causes them. During these low periods, i get the usual cant get out bed, numbness, no energy, can't sleep, don't eat or binge eat. Just wallowing in this wretched self pity. 

However, recently (the past year) I believe these low periods have gotten worse. Its like I'm watching myself go crazy. I hate the fact the awareness if the situation makes me feel worse. I dont know what to call these new things so I'll just do a little list.

- I get paranoid that my right arm is not mine and that it is controlled by something else. If dont chant to myself that my arm is mine, I want to cut it off. 

-i won't let myself sleep as a punishment or I'll make myself cold/freezing

-rarely I'll forget who I am or where I am. I think it doesnt last long maybe like 10 minutes.

-this one only happens when it's really really really bad. In the low periods I'm short tempered, when my sister angers me and pushes me over the edge I'm very tempted to hurt her. Last time, it took me so long to convince myself not to stab her.

Those things only happen in the low period and the last two when my mental health is extremely bad. I know I should talk to gp and get some sort of help.

so i’m a 20 year old female and i think there’s a chance i might have adhd? but at the same time i’m not sure, because certain things don’t add up.


to start, up until 10th/11th grade i never had a real problem in school. straight as and i always got my shit done on time (always last minute - but turned in when it needed to be) but when i got to 11th grade and started taking classes that didn’t come easy to me i realized that studying especially was not something i could do - it’s not that i didn’t want to, i genuinely couldn’t focus when i tried and i hated it so much, the idea made me sick. even when i try i physically cannot focus for more than 10 mins tops before my brain starts to wander and i end up absorbing nothing. up until then i’d been that kid that didn’t need to study which i think is why i did so well for so long. when i got to college especially it became noticeable bc studying often requires a lot of reading and practice which i just can’t bring myself to do. i feel guilty for not doing it but it just hurts my brain, unless it’s something i like, and even then i still can’t focus but my brain retains the info better.

i’ve also been a very emotional angry person for as long as i can remember. ever since i was a toddler i’ve had these intense outbursts of anger that came from seemingly nothing - and i mean i would literally scream at people (one person mostly) for no reason. i still have major issues with it today and tend to get these super intense feelings of anger; it leads me to be impulsive and i’ve ruined several friendships because of it. my impulsivity has also led me to quit jobs on a whim and burn bridges in the process. i buy things i don’t need frequently and have a major issue with saving my money. my mood swings are intense to the point where i feel like i want to actually die (never acted on it though).  they don’t happen that often any more but i’ve been in therapy for three and a half years so i’m better at managing emotions, lmao.

i’m also really forgetful to the point where it’s caused me major problems. i miss things that are literally right in front of me, i have to be told at least three times to do something before there’s a chance at me actually doing it (not because i don’t wanna do it - because i literally forget that i was asked to do it in the first place. it simply disappears from my mind). it’s caused fights with my mom my entire childhood and i also have a chronic illness so i’m constantly forgetting to take my meds and email my doctors back. i’ve been lucky with jobs/bosses but i’ve made really careless mistakes and forgotten to do my fair share of things at those jobs.

the thing is that despite all of this which is not uncommon for kids/adults with adhd is that i don’t remember being much of a fidgeter at all. i know it presents different in girls and it’s not unusual for young girls with adhd to not be disruptive, but i don’t think i’ve ever had a problem with staying still? in class i usually space out (again, unless i’m interested in what’s being said) and either draw on my paper or go on my laptop/phone. this is pretty standard for neurotypical people though - at least i think it is. i do have a really bad habit of peeling my nails off especially when i’m in a situation that requires focus and i’ve been doing that forever.  i also used to talk a LOT as a kid and because of that combined with the other behaviors i did not have a lot of real friends until college. i still tend to talk a lot but i’m able to censor myself a bit now and i’ve found people who are willing to listen. i’ve also never experienced hyperfocus...i don’t think i have anyway. there are times where i can very much get absorbed in a book or game i like and not move for hours but again, this might be normal. 

i guess i’m looking to see if anyone who has been diagnosed had an experience similar to mine. i have a therapist and i do plan on talking to her, but i also want some input from random people on the internet bc it’s 2021. maybe i’m just trying to find an excuse for my laziness and other bad behaviors, but maybe there is a reason behind all of it. thanks for listening!",mentalhealth,2021-01-22 22:11:29

I am going on 19 and I weigh like 110 pounds. I’m like 5’5” so I’m not tall I’m small and skinny and I hate the way my body looks. Everyone seems to see me as a frail being who couldn’t protect himself or others. My friends, my partner they’ve all commented that I couldn’t fight. I don’t go around picking fights but I know I can fight. There’s one person who’s not in my life anymore but he saw me take a punch to the face and not even flinch. He’s the only person who might look at me and see someone who can protect themselves. I hate it because I want to be able to protect the ones that I love. If some creep tries to be sexual with my partner I want to be able to shake his hand and he’ll piss himself and leave my partner alone. I want my partner to feel safe with me not like they have to protect me. I know for a fact they can fight. I still talk about how they hit a dude in the back of the knees with a baseball bat to get him out of their house when he was looking for trouble. I don’t see my partner as weak at all. They’re a goddamn badass, but I feel like I’m the weak one. I want have more muscle mass. I know I’m just a kid with fast metabolism but it still bothers me that I look like I should be hospitalized if I miss a meal. I hate listening to people comment on my weight all the time. And I don’t feel comfortable talking about this with my partner or other people that I’m close with because they struggle with body dysmorphia and stuff and they wish they were as skinny as me sometimes so it kinda feels selfish to talk about how much I hate this. I’m working towards a firefighting career and when I graduate this year I have a secured construction job and I don’t want to show up to either of those looking like I can’t do the job because too big of a drill will break me. 

I also have a problem with self harm. Never cut myself though. See, I keep venomous arthropods. Spiders, scorpions, centipedes, the like. And I genuinely don’t know how many times I’ve self inflicted a sting or a bite. I usually do it under the guise of scientific study and to prove that bitch Coyote Peterson is overrated and toxic. But truthfully, I like it when I’m stung by the most venomous scorpion in North America, a species that makes my entire arm numb for almost a week. And I like it because...could a weak person do that? Could a weak person get bit by a tarantula and laugh it off? It’s the only thing that really makes me feel strong. Actually I tend to do a lot of reckless stuff like that to feel strong. I caught a wild four foot alligator with my bare hands. I take snake bites for fun. I’ll play with fire too. Dumb shit because I look weak so it’s the only way I feel I can make myself appear strong. I’m set to do a brown recluse bite soon. I’ve done a ton of research on the venom and the bite and I known I’ll be safe. They’re not much deadly than a house spider. By that I mean they’re harmless. Don’t believe me? Dm me I’ll send you the article that I wrote. I’ll send you videos and articles others have written. Truthfully, everything I’ve done may seem badass but it’s just reckless and puts the animal in danger more than anything. I think I killed my hobo spider trying to get bitten. I’m not strong for doing it. And anyone else who does it isn’t either. They’re just playing on the misconceptions the general public has about venom. You see Coyote Peterson and the Kings of Pain or sting or whatever that show is called and I promise you, they’re not some god for taking those venoms. They’re just trying to get paid, fame, or appear strong like I am. 

I just want to look strong and I want people to know that I’m strong. I know what I can take. I know my limits. I can take a lot. I can fight back too. But no one else knows that. And I’m tired of it. Maybe I’m just a dumb kid trying too hard. Idk. I just I’m tired of people thinking that I’m weak and that I can’t fight. I don’t even want to fight. I’ve fought a few times in my life and it was only to protect someone else. That’s all that I want. Is for people to know they can rely on me.",mentalhealth,2021-01-22 22:38:05

i dont trust anyone. at all. everythings a conspiracy. not usually against me, though. at least, not as a singular direct target. i dont see a future for myself. ive accomplished nothing. many things ive started have failed very quickly. it seems every time i start doing better something goes horribly horribly wrong. ive improved soooo much over 8 or so years, but  at the same time, i havent gone anywhere either.

my curiosity is only matched by my perversion and lust. the dials for both say max 10 but theyre still spinning clockwise trying to find a number high enough to represent them. the greatest curiosity is whats after life. the biggest unknown. the unreturnable unknown. where all truth will be revealed. but... while this current existence sucks... theres things i KNOW exist and i like them. itd be lame if i off myself and its just blackness forever, though i dont follow that theory of the afterlife. but it could be, who knows.. itd be rather boring. id go nuts, if im even able to.

i desire to either fulfill vices or enjoy actual good things... but only cuz i know theyre here and real and the other side is 100% mystery. im scared of change and uncertainty. but, im also certain this existence is torture and pain. 

just.. i want it to end. now. ahh too late.

also dont report this to the suicide hotline bot cuz i aint calling the number. last time i did they did nothing productive and made me worse. ive even escaped from the hospital to avoid being put in the ward cuz i know itd be worse for me. feel bad for that doctor though... awell. he didnt listen.

My whole life I've feel like I've been split in two. I have anger issues beyond control that cause me to lash out and say terrible things to the people I love that I 100% don't mean, and when I've calmed down I don't even know how to apologize because I have no idea what I was thinking. The worst part is my anger issues aren't triggered by anything. It just suddenly... happens. And it's been happening for as long as I remember. 

I never get angry at my normal friends or classmates or acquaintances or anything. It's only when I love someone / am super close to someone that I get so terrible and I have no idea what to do. I really don't know what to do at this point because I genuinely can't control it. I also have sudden bouts of really intense feelings, like yearning or sadness or happiness that also seemingly aren't triggered by anything.  The anger just stands out most.

Of the people I've loved, none of them have been bad to me except for 1. There's literally no reason for my sudden bursts of hellish rage... it even happens when they're being so nice and caring and comforting to me.

I grew up with a relatively broken family and I won't elaborate on my unfortunate childhood experiences, but I thought I'd mention it in case it's important.

Other things:

I find myself extremely clingy and afraid of abandonment, but at the same time sometimes I randomly kick people I'm close with out of my life for no reason. I can't even explain it I don't know.

Sometimes I 100% feel I love someone and then an hour later 100% feel I hate them (once again, not triggered by anything... it just happens)

I can't even tell if I'm depressed or suicidal or what, because my answer changes depending on the ""flip"". For example, right now I can't even fathom being depressed, but I almost attempted in the past and it's kinda bizarre to me.",mentalhealth,2021-01-22 22:48:45

I'm not good at writing myself out in words so please bear with me as I try and describe it as best I can :)

For a good while now (more than a few months but I can't remember exactly how long) I've been unable to do the things I enjoy. 

I can physically do them but it feels like a force inside myself that stops me doing it after a short while, and a force inside myself that stops me enjoying it. I don't know what this force is... I just know I feel it and it feels like it's holding me back from doing the things I love. 

I don't think it's depression, because I'm content most of the time, and I don't think I'm tired of doing these things I enjoy, because I have a very deep interest in these things that's been there most of my life, or for as long as I can remember. 

But yet I can watch youtube videos on these things for hours, read about them for hours, or chat to people for a long time about them, so I know I'm not tired of them.

I'm not good at describing or knowing what feelings are, let alone knowing what I'm feeling... so I don't know what this is.

Does anybody have any ideas what this force could be? And how do I deal with it it so I can do the things I love again?

I've tried doing different things, but nothing else interests me as much as these things... so it's not that I need something different or ""new"" either.

Or maybe have an idea of what I'm experiencing? None of my mental health professionals know and I'm going insane over it.,"Buckle up, it's a wild (and kinda long) one. **\*\*TL;DR included\*\***

So I've had my fair share of psychiatric hospitalizations. I suffer from recurrent depression and general anxiety and have for over a decade (I'm 21), and it's led to some nasty situations causing me to be hospitalized in the first place. I'm sure you can guess why so I'll spare the details.

About 5 years ago, I got hit with a PTSD diagnosis and have been in outpatient therapy since. Constant anxiety, depressed mood, flashbacks... The whole smorgasbord. But starting in late 2019, I've been having other stuff happen that my therapist (or any other) and psychiatrist can't seem to pin down.

It started with feeling like my brain is...split? That's the best way I've been able to describe it. Like, I have control of one part of my mind and not the other. Like, I have part-ownership of my thoughts and feelings, but there are parts that are locked away from me. I've just kinda dubbed it ""split-brain"" because I haven't been told anything else (please let me know if this is offensive language in any way).

So after that, I dealt with intense paranoia and then shadowy visual hallucinations. My psychiatrist said it was depression and threw meds my way. So I was like, ""okay sure."" And they worked! So I was good, and still mostly am to this day.

But then it got *weird*.

In March of 2020, I experienced an extremely long dissociative episode. Until July 5th, I had lost feeling in my own body. Like, yeah I could still move and walk and drive, but it felt more like I was some sort of puppet master or some kind of mecha pilot looking through a screen where my eyes were. I couldn't be precise or articulate much with my hands in the time period either. At this time, the ""split-brain"" wasn't too much of an often occurrence. It happened maybe a couple of times a month.

Then on September 10th, I started experiencing...thoughts? But they weren't mine! Not my voice, or how I talk, or even things I was actively thinking about. It was just persistent shouting in my head for like, 5 days (which wasn't great timing since I was at an inpatient psych hospital at the time). It sounded masculine (I'm a woman) and kept trying to urge me to hurt myself. I never did, but it was like being in middle school hearing those dumb kids say ""no balls, no balls, bet you won't,"" just constantly every waking minute. And one night the voice got so angry and threatening, I, and I mean this, *feared for my life* that something would happen to me if I didn't do what it was telling me. And this isn't even the first time I've thought/heard that thought/voice. It happened previously on July 5th but wasn't as violent.

I've had a psych evaluation done, and I have the same diagnoses, with the added bonus of a sweet combo personality disorder of borderline and avoidant personality elements, and PTSD now with ""dissociative features."" This test was done in late November.

So here I am on Reddit in 2021. I still feel the ""split-brain"" and that thought/voice hasn't been thought/heard since September. I fall in and out of dissociation many times throughout the day now, however, even as I'm typing this. My worst bit was when I was completely gone during New Years' Day. Apparently, I just stopped eating at the dinner table abruptly and had my head down for a solid 10 minutes. And believe me, I remember nearly *nothing* from those 10 minutes. If anything, it was like I was underwater, and I heard chattering from my family, but I don't know how long or about what. All I remember is eating and shooting the shit during dinner. I wasn't drinking nor under any influence. I've spaced out before, but never, ever, like that.

So what's the deal? Anyone ever experienced this? Heard of it? Maybe got a subreddit or website recommendation? Ted Talk? YouTube video? I'll honestly take anything. I really just want to know what's going on with me to put me at ease after all this time. I'll take anything the Internet gives me before I keep dishing out cash to another therapist or four.

**\*\*TL;DR**: I'm a 21 y/o woman with diagnosed depression, anxiety, and personality disorder. Recently I was rediagnosed of having PTSD with ""dissociative features"", and it shows. I feel like I've lost control of portions of my mind and hear/have thoughts of *something or someone that isn't me.* I lose feeling of my body and recently had an event where I was conscious to others but have little to no memory of it, not due to any drug of any kind. What gives?

I, myself, lil ole me, can not form friendships or romantic relationships. I went into a spiral and participated in unhealthy casual hookups for the last six months, and with the last guy I tried to sleep with I broke down in front of him. I couldn’t handle the fear of abandonment anymore after being attached to someone like that. I had gone through it everytime I ended a casual hookup relationship even though we had all discussed that boundary.

It’s so rare for me to have an open discussion about mental health struggles as I’ve learned through social media, talks with family and friends, not everyone will understand and you need to be wise with who you open you’r heart to.
I want you to know that you’re not alone, not in the struggle, not in the darkest moments when all seems isolating and cold, you are not alone in this.
There are so many people who love you.
I love you!
We all love you, even if you haven’t met us.
We love you because you are us!
You are not alone because together we are stronger and able to fight this.
Even when you can’t make it out of bed today, even when you can’t bring you fingers to dial out, we are there, we know, we understand, we care, we love you when you can’t.
Days may be dark and lonely, when we struggle with shame, with frustrations of not being able to get out of bed or make a meal, to simply let the day go by doing our best to just exist one more day...
Then days will come as they have been hiding in the clouds of memories the sunshine, the small joys that sprinkled through our childhood trauma, through our illnesses, those moments where the light starts to overcome the dark.
When we become true to ourselves and who we are and proud of being a survivor a warrior of doing the unthinkable because we overcame all odds and made it to this day to this moment.
When we become true to ourselves and find the light in blindness of the world around a us, I hope we can stand proud of our accomplishments and represent US!
Let us be united and stop the stigma of shameful taboo quieting statements from others that say to simply get over it, to not talk about the parts of ourselves that are very real and not a choice. Let’s share with others so they understand too, so there will be less bullies and more education.
It’s sad that I find too few people to open up with and be real with because of the risk or being shut down.
If you’re ever wondering, you are so worth each day, of what simple or complex joys the world has to offer you. Deserving of Love, Acceptance and Tolerance!
We love and accept you for who you are, and you are wonderful.",mentalhealth,2021-01-22 23:49:28

He worked, paid the bills, made sure we didn't die, and that's pretty much it. A classic raised-in-the-60s-on-a-farm-with-a-big-family-immigrant-dad. That being said he never beat us or intentionally tried to destroy us so that's good. He has always been bearable. Nice enough guy, relatively normal, had some friends, had a stable trades career, hobbies, likes music, etc.   

My mom died of cancer when my sister and I wear 9 and 11. Soon after he dated and married a friend of both of their's and rumour has it they were sleeping together while she was dying. After many years of the town hating on them, we moved away, and two years after that they divorced and she took him for half. He dated a colourful array of women following her, but one has always been around. Let’s call her Lisa. I, too, have always been around since just recently when I moved out to live with my boyfriend. This tidbit seems to have fast tracked his mental state, whatever that state is. 


Anyhow Lisa came into my dads life 5 years ago. Since then, he now believes vaccination will kill all babies, COVID vaccines will basically kill you upon injection, chemo is awful and the only way to beat cancer is through frequencies, the government is always trying to kill us, we should never use phones (he uses his all day everyday), etc. etc. 5G is satan, he is god. I'm not saying there isn't a bit of truth to any of this, but he believes his word is gospel. 


He is becoming the town nut.. for lack of better words. He goes around spewing this to everyone in the main cafe in our small town.  


It got worse when my sister had a baby 1.5 years ago.  He comes to their house unannounced all the time and ALWAYS without fail, talks about vaccinations. He practically says she's going to die because they vaccinated her, they shouldn't have vaccinated her. She was recently diagnosed with asthma.. you bet your ass he was over and said it was cause the vaccinations and they shouldn't have vaccinated her. She is 1.5 now, she says some words but she's not super verbal - understands everything though and can walk. He comes over and tells them that she's really behind on her talking because of the vaccines. He is always telling them they're poisoning her. She recently had croup - yep, vaccinations. 


My grandma is 86, she wants the covid vaccine. He personally called all his 7 brothers and sisters saying that he'll lose his shit if she gets the vaccine and they're all trying to kill her.   


A local young man was recently going for cancer treatment, and to his doom he came to the cafe my dad was at. Chemo was his last chance at survival yet my dad goes on to say that chemo is a joke, it will never work, he would have never let my mom take chemo if he knew what he knew now.  

He also says he would never have vaccinated us if he knew what he knew now. Even though we are both very healthy girls lacking almost any health problems whatsoever.   


LET ME BE CLEAR HERE! I AM NOT SAYING THAT VACCINATIONS COULD AND MAY WELL BE TERRIBLE. IT IS THE ABSOLUTE ARROGANCE, INSENSITIVITY, AND SENSE OF GODLINESS THAT COMES WITH HIS CARELESS SPREAD OF NEGATIVITY IN OUR EVERYDAY LIVES.  


So basically what I'm asking here is what is going on his brain all of a sudden to think he is the ruler of all. He was never in our lives much to suppose us at all - but now he wants to “save us” from imminent doom. Where is this coming from? He has been mostly level headed for 50 years and now everyone else is a sheep and is making incorrect decisions. We're about to cut him off... he doesn’t listen to us, he doesn’t think anything is wrong with him, etc. We are hoping there is another option.  


**TL;DR - My widowed dad has been mostly level headed most of his life, but emotionally absent and has never been there for us. Over the past 5 years he has been believing that vaccinations, chemo, 5G, etc are the end of the world and he thinks he's going to save us or something if we just listen to him. He calls my sister or pops up out of the blue daily to tell her they made a mistake in vaccinating their child. He is careless, and negative, and we're about to cut him off after many years of putting up with his behaviour and asking him not to do what he does everyday .

I was added to his call list as I was the only person he wanted to call. 

We only got 10 minutes. I was pretty nervous to be honest. I just hope I said the correct things.

Through tears I told him that it broke my heart that he had been feeling that way about himself. I also told him that the world wouldn't be the same without him in. Cliche... I know... But I just felt I needed to express to him how important he is to me somehow. 

He changed the subject shortly after and he talked about how boring it was there and how bad the food was. He was still teasing me and making me laugh. He seemed pretty grumpy too. 

I have been encouraged to call him again tomorrow night and am thinking maybe I will call each night during his stay just to break up the boredom. 

So I'm just here to get ideas and support. What should I say? What kinds of things do you think he might want to talk about? I have pretty bad anxiety so I'm just worried about saying the wrong thing. I just want to be as helpful and supportive as possible.

I had more time to workout, play games, be with friends, etc. In the span from March to now, I've tried Runescape, gotten 9 days worth of gameplay over summer vacation. Even made a friend, who I still hope is ok. I've gotten a puppy and kitten. Seen improvement in my weightlifting. I've been with my parents more as well. 
That's just the summary of it, but then there's the bad that's happened. 
That friend I've made in Runescape, he told me his girlfriend cheated on him, had a mental breakdown, and we haven't talked much since. Holiday's feel depressing now, since before lots of family would show up to see eachother, where as Christmas was so much fewer people. When I said I got to be with friends more, I meant online through games. Lots of them I barely even talk to now. I've had a history of having mood swings here and there, but over quarantine I feel like they've gotten worse. I miss the social aspect of being at school, instead of being in online classes, where half the time the teacher gets disconnected because they have trash internet. 
Then I thought, you know what, things have been pretty bad and good at the same time, let's try and make things better so I can forget about the bad.
I ranted to my crush whom knows that I like, about how I feel, and they actually liked that I told them about it, and to be honest, I was expecting them to react a lot less, since I was doing it to mainly get it off my chest, and even told them so.
This is all over Instagram btw, remember, we can't see eachother because of the virus. They asked me why I decided to text them, and I responded honestly by saying that since I've got a lot more time on my hands, I ended up thinking of them from time to time. 
I think that was a bad response, because I ended up getting left on read. I know this isn't a subreddit on relationship advice, and that's not what I'm asking here, let me continue. 
It's been two weeks since that happened, and ever since, I feel kind of empty, been sleeping more throughout the day, falling behind on school, and just not seeing a purpose in life, even though I have so much of, well, everything. 
Am I being selfish here, or is it normal to feel this way. The more I think about it the more I feel like this feeling has just been bottled up, and me texting that person was the last push I needed for me to be in this mood. I'm of course not blaming them however, I actually kind of blame myself for texting them, I should've just moved on. 
If you're worried about me hurting anyone or myself, don't worry, I'm just sad, not stupid. I say that because as I read what I've wrote, people might think that, so I'm just giving reassurance. Don't be afraid to tell me I'm overreacting or just being a little edgy teenager, I want to know how you see this, in honest truth.",mentalhealth,2021-01-23 01:22:32

I am an 18 year old guy. My parents divorced when I was 10. I never moved on. My dog died 2 months ago (Nov 20, 2020) I still grieve.

I have severe depression. It's probably from my porn addiction. I am someone who constantly looks on the negative side of things.

My mother encourages me to be a positive thinker but a part of me doesn't want to even try because it feels like I'm lying if I try to think positively and... I feel like it's not going to end with me being positive but with nothing changing as always. I want to learn how to.

Last monday. My father came to my mother's house to talk with me over me insulting his dad while texting my dad. We were ready to have an argument. But then he gave me an armor piercing question: ""Why are you angry?"" From there on, I slowly broke down. I confessed I held nothing against his dad as I was actually lashing out at my dad. I confessed I never moved on from their divorce 8 years ago and in that moment I was blaming him. My parents realized immediately this was serious and my dad abandoned his anger to help me. It was painful to say the least to just... let it all out. By the end, I learned no matter who I blamed, no matter if I found all the details that happened during their divorce. I would never find peace since at the end of the day, the only way for me to even begin healing after 8 years of pain that I didn't even realize was still there... was for me to forgive them. Since this was just a few days ago. I am no where near being fully healed from my parent's divorce.

2 months ago, I noticed my dog, Luna, had stopped eating but we thought she was being picky. But I knew my fears were valid when she had diarrea. I took her to the vet on the 19th and they said she had a cancerous tumor, we let her stay with them over night to see if they could do anything. By morning on the 20th... I received world shattering news... We could either give her a surgery that had a low chance of success... or we could end her suffering peacefully. We picked her up at 12. We spent the remaining 6 hours we had left being with her. We took her to see a neighborhood we spent 5 years living in. We took her for one last walk, but since she was still recovering from the relaxants we put her in a wagon and pulled her around the neighborhood. She spent her time out in the yard and we brought out her bed and a blanket so she wouldn't be cold. I made a watercolor painting of her. When it was time. I carried her out of the car and into the vet. I signed the papers myself authorizing the euthanization and then... I was the last thing she saw as she slipped away peacefully. After realizing she was dead, I collapsed, sobbing. From then on while I have dealt with the grief, I still grieve and am worried it'll never leave.

I have been a porn addict since I was 11. I've been desperately trying anything which will help me recover... but nothing's worked. I'm beyond terrified I'm going to be addicted to porn for a very long time. I want out.

I've been depressed for who knows how long. I don't know when it started but I realized I was depressed during last year's summer. My mother has helped as best she can and she encourages me to be a more positive person, but I feel like I can't since I let my past weigh me down and nowadays all that I can see are the ghosts of my past and I feel down all the time, everyday.

I don't know what to do. I'm desperate. I want to stop hurting. I want to feel happy. I WANT TO MOVE ON FROM MY PARENT'S DIVORCE, I WANT LUNA BACK, I WANT HER BACK SO MUCH!!! I WANT TO STOP BEING SAD!!

Over the last 5 years or so my family life has had a good bit of ups and downs. Mainly my mom has been put through a lot physically, mentally and emotionally during this time. I can clearly see she's been troubled by her experience divorce, kidney failure, and alcoholism all during these years. As anytime would be. 

She's definitely one of the strongest women I know when it comes to tackling life head on. But recently I've been getting more and more worried about something that happened once from what I know, to every few months or so happening. 

One night with my family all home we smoked weed together and everything was fine until it was late and it was just me and my mom. Out of nowhere she suddenly looked incredibly anxious and concerned asking me who I am and to get out of her house. When I tried to reason explaining I'm her son she kept saying that I'm not the real me, along with lots of behaviour such as not making eye contact, acting petty, and irrational. All out of nowhere. 

Me not knowing the first thing to do just tried to reason with her for about and hour before I finally decided it was best for me to leave and let her be as it seemed my presence was the cause for this. Luckily my brother came home later and I explained everything that happened and that she either hates me or was going through some psychotic break and he went upstairs to check on her. 

She claimed she had numerous people in the room with her when I was there, they were threatening her and claiming bad things were going to happen. And that there was an imposter me. She didn't even recognize my brother but he was able to slightly converse. After we both talked it seemed clear to us she had a psychotic episode. The morning after she was fine and didn't remember anything but her hallucinations if you'd even call it that. 

That was around 8-10 months ago, I'm posting now looking for advice because I'll occasionally hear sobbing upstairs. She still drinks heavily so I've assumed it's that. But tonight she had a friend over for the first time in a while and after not drinking for a week or so got drunk. 

I'm sitting in my room wrapping up my night on my computer and I start hearing her call me upstairs. I rushed up and asked what's up, she had that same blank distasteful look on her face. No matter how many times I'd try to plea with her to talk to me immediately after I got up there she said it's nothing, then would turn her head sigh and act disturbed. Just like the one night we all had smoked together.

What I've sadly come to think is I believe her mental health has been deteriorating for quite some time now due to everything she's been experiencing, and we're just now starting to notice. It seems like whether it's weed, booze or what that psychoactive substances trigger a psychotic episode for her. From everything I've gathered with my personal experience it's always happened after substance use.

Now I've obviously become increasingly worried about her and the whole situation. Not really knowing what to do, or even what I could potentially do. If she needs help I want her to get what she needs but don't know how to go about it. I feel like getting her to possibly stop her drug use would definitely help her, I know you can't help an addict unless they truly want the help for themselves. So I'm deeply lost on what to do, I'm about to turn 22. With no real knowledge of this kind of stuff and figured it'd be a good place to start and ask. 

Thank you for reading, very much appreciated.",mentalhealth,2021-01-23 02:05:15

I’ve never really made a post like this in my life, but I could use some advice on moving on.

For some context, my girlfriend (18F) of almost two years broke up with me (19M) about six months ago (that number surprised me). Even though she was my first girlfriend, she was extraordinarily special to me. I really did believe I would have her for a long, long time, and she seemed to reciprocate those feelings to me, too. But pretty much out of the blue, she wanted to end things, mainly to focus on herself (I think).

I didn’t take this well. I never got mad or angry at her, but I dealt with a lot of the emotions on my own, and I have been ever since. I willingly stopped speaking to her about a month after the breakup for my own mental health, but cutting her out hasn’t changed how much I love her or how much I miss being with her. What also sucks is that she seemingly moved on so fast, and she made it pretty clear that she doesn’t want to get back with me, at least for a long time.

Anyways, as for the mental health part of this situation, it’s obvious I can’t get over her. But it’s bled into other areas of my life. I have a lot of troubles sleeping at night even though I’m tired during the day. It’s much harder for me to focus on things. I get randomly depressed (usually at night) and it impacts my entire mood for a day or two. I just feel like I’m an entirely new person in all the wrong ways, and I almost feel pathetic that I can’t move on from a high school relationship. But it’s the truth, and I don’t know what to do anymore. Does anybody have any advice for moving on from someone you love?",mentalhealth,2021-01-23 03:10:09

And apologies for the long read.

So I have an issue of constantly facing stress and anxiety alot of the time, even in situations where it really shouldn't be something you face, and like most people I don't do very well under stress. However, the issue for me is, I have an odd case where I manage to fail very easy and simple tasks.

Let me give you a backstory as an example.
So not too long ago I was on my way somewhere with my parents and we had to stop to fuel up the car. We stopped and my parents told me the windows needed cleaning, doesn't sound too hard right? Well, for me it was :|. I start stressing out(for whatever reason) and I grab the window wipers they have available there. There are 2 ends on the wiper, the sponge used for applying water and the scraper to clean off the water. I go and use...the scraper end to apply the water...after a few moments of me not realising what to do and my parents getting frustrated at me, my mum takes over and I get back in the car to rethink my life. You see how bad ny situation is?

Everytime a situation where I manage to fail an absolutely simple task comes up, I would always tell myself I'm a loser and weak and useless and that's just how I'm gunna be in life. However, recently I realized that when I'm not stressed, I can easily do a task whether it's easy or hard just as well as any other person can. But when it comes to me being stressed and anxious, I turn a simple task that everyone wouldn't even think twice about, my brain just goes into caveman mode and makes that task a super Inconvenient and impossible job that I need help with.

This. Is. A. Major. Issue. And I need help before my life really takes off. Like I am really concerned about getting a job and my employer fires me because they can see how absolutely useless I am. Or driving and making a fatal mistake that was so easy to avoid.

Hopefully someone can give me some tips on how to do better during stressful and anxiety inducing situations so I can avoid making retarded mistakes any more. Any help would be majorly appreciated.",mentalhealth,2021-01-23 03:24:33

I am a 22 y/o adult undiagnosed. I have had people in my life say that I have Autism over the years and I always thought it was a joke and didn’t think anything of it. For a few years I’ve often had semi-serious discussions with loved ones that I sometimes think that I have a mental disorder and that other people know and don’t tell me and they would kinda laugh it off. And a few weeks ago I saw some video by someone with autism joking about some of their traits and it really resonated with me because I had a lot of the same traits. I couldn’t let it go and talked to my family about it and they were being weird about it, but honest, they said it would make a lot of sense. 

I don’t like being touched by anyone but my girlfriend. I’m really obsessive about things. I very rarely have extreme bursts of anger, over things that are minute. I’m pretty academically gifted despite not applying myself I average a 3.7 GPA even with missing assignments. I get a lot more confused in group settings and I always tacked it up to being anxious despite being very social with small groups or people I know. In grade school, I wore the same jacket everyday all day, even wore dress shoes instead of sneakers and would buy the same pair every time. In second grade I was reading Stephen King and spent breaks talking to teachers about the book because kids my age didn’t want to talk about things I liked or could even hold up a good conversation. In junior high I was reading things like Dante’s inferno and the epic of Gilgamesh and volunteered in the lunchroom and library at the breaks. I’ve never been antisocial and am actually pretty adept at social cues I think, but something has always felt off about me and I think that this is it.

I don’t really know what to do about it now. I don’t know if I want to go get tested or not. I’m very anxious and I don’t want it to change anything in my life or how I see things or how people see me. There’s a lot of stigma that I never thought about or bought into until now and it’s very upsetting.",mentalhealth,2021-01-23 03:25:23

My fear and anxiety about death, especially dying early because of illness, have been haunting me for the past 2 years and in recent months it got stronger. I am physically healthy in general but whenever I have discomfort in some area of my body I would just automatically fear that it’s cancer. I have a supportive boyfriend that would comfort me and cheer me up when I have panic attacks but his reasoning of trying to not fearing death doesn’t convince me.

Lately I’ve been having nightmares about my dad passing away. He’s been having a type of leukemia for over ten years. His condition has been very stable thanks to Gleevec although it won’t cure the cancer and he has to take it for a lifetime. I start wondering if my fear of death stems from worrying about my dad’s death and worrying about me having a higher risk of developing serious illness like his due to genetics. But I don’t really know how to resolve the worries since they are technically true.

My anxiety has gotten so bad and consistent that I’m worried it’ll affect my physical health as well. I think it might be worth a shot to go to a therapist but I don’t know if I can afford it.

I didn't have a bedroom, didn't shower for days, sleep, or do any school work. The only thing my mom actively cared about was that i get home before dark and that i dont get her in trouble for missing too much school. I this all started when i was around 8 and i was having depression, anxiety, and self esteem issues. It continued for the next 4-5 years until she died of a heart attack.

Her dying didn't make things any better mentally, it left me with a lot of guilt. I watched her collapse and i couldn't do anything to help, then afterwards i just felt empty. I cried at her funeral because i felt like i should, instead of feeling sad that she was gone or missing her. My life felt much better without her, i was actually being taken care of, but I hated myself deeply for it. 

I try to hate her for being negligent and for dying so early. It would make dealing with this easier, however i know it was just bad situation for both of us. She was a single mother and i was her youngest son and twin to her only daughter. She simply didn't have the time, energy, or capacity to notice my problems and I wouldn't communicate them ever.

Compared to people with physical/mental abuse, this all feels insignificant. Its sad and all, but at least she didn't beat me or yell at me.

Everytime I try to be positive my mind does this automatic fear response to that feeling and I lose that positive emotion (or any emotion) suddenly. I like forget what I did feel and it becomes more and more exhausting the more fear and panic attacks I get. 

I have been fighting to my anxiety for a long time but it becomes stronger and stronger and it causes to make me exhausted and when I try to find something positive the fear is always fighting me back which numbs my positive feeling.

I am very afraid or I am trying to be. I feel like I am not going to feel any emotion ever again. And I just want to die but I don’t even feel like dying. 

This is only getting worse. I am getting a doctor of some sort next monday but I think it isn’t going to help.

PS. I had like OCD and depression like a year or two ago (not treated because I was too afraid to tell). When corona started the feeling just had been getting worse. I had fears of schizophrenia which triggered my anxiety even more.

PPS. I am from Finland so pardon my language.",mentalhealth,2021-01-23 04:09:09

This dream had two scenes in it, the first one was me sitting in a classroom during an examination. The weather was cloudy and the atmosphere was dull, the class consists less than about 10 students so it was quite a small amount. I eventually stood up from my chair and started cussing out loud with anger and irritation. The scene then shifted with no warning and I was all a sudden a worker in a fast food restaurant. I had a bucket in front of me and could feel something grumble aggressively inside my tummy. I then vomited completely missing the bucket and spilled all over the floor. I been thinking about this dream ever since and thought, it's just a bunch of horse pucky. That was until I gave it a chance to see what the message was behind it. 

It blew my mind. Turns out, the first scene of me cussing signifies stress and worries in my everyday waking life. It means that this is an unhappy time, there may be repressed emotion waiting to burst. That I need to face and deal with these once and for all. The second scene about vomiting means that I would like to remove something from my life. That includes feelings of negativity and certain thoughts, so I would like to get rid of them. It also means that I'm rejecting some feelings and beliefs.

I only believed the main message because I could relate. To put those two together message wise makes it sound very true. The stress and worries, repressed emotions and the need of dealing with these segments. To wanting to remove negative feelings and thoughts. It's unusual that I use my dream to signify the signs or roots of my problems, I don't normally look deep into stuff like this. It was worth looking into. Dreams that tells you something really important about how you feel in your waking life.",mentalhealth,2021-01-23 04:12:44

I grew up in the beginning pretty normal. It was me my mom my dad my half brother (didn't know he was half at the time) and my two step siblings (thought they where half siblings at the time)  I would go every other day to my grandparents house alone without the other siblings and always wondered why I alone had an extra set grandparents that my siblings did not share. I would later at my great Grandma's funeral learn that they where the parents of my biological fathers parents. (who signed his rights away) I also learned my younger cousin was actually my little brother  this started a chain where I felt lied to hurt and even tho now I see my dad as a great man who took on a child that wasn't his, I felt like I could not trust him. Somewhere in the following years that now feel like a dream (between 5- 12) I was molested by my older step sister and told it was what older siblings are supposed to teach there younger siblings for when they get a boyfriend/girlfriend. The following weekend with this put in my head I passed that curse on to my new little brother, thinking it was what I was supposed to do. Worse to come my mom's unbeknownst to me drug problem got out of hand and she was in and out of my life for years so that took the majority of my attention for the time and I pushed the sexual abuses deep in my mind and convinced myself they where a dream. Now my step sister moved to Florida at some point in all of this but at some point I asked her about it when she asked if I wanted to do it again still not realizing what had happened since I was so young I tried to dismiss this as a dream as well. So back to my parents they would be on and off again so we would move alot I never stayed in one school very long until late right grade. At that time after attempting suicide many times and bring in and out of mental health facilities I finally convinced my dad to let me live with my biological fathers mom(and my half brother from my bio dad) her husband my grandpa and best friend had died not to long before this along with both of my adopted dad's parents who I and my half brother from my mom had been raised by when our parents where in a broken up period. They both died one after the other and it was a very hard time for us all. During most of  my middle school years my mom was also in florida in""rehab"" and the first time I saw her in I'm not even sure how many years I had to kick her out of my grandma's house cause she was high with some dude ( who I later met and seemed like a nice but troubled man). This event broke me all I wanted to do was cry and hug my mom but I couldn't I knew it would just get me in a bad situation I was a freshman or sophomore I think. This all lead me from age 15 to 19 to smoking copious amounts of pot to numb the pain ( I started smoking at 11 thinks to older kids I hung with and my biological father) now I'm not against pot and I still occasionally smoke but my relationship with it was unhealthy. I ended up dropping out of high school because I never did homework and even tho I passed all my test I still flunked most classes because all I wanted to do was get high or play ESO to escape my reality. I had 17 credits as a senior. This isn't even everything and I know it's disorderly and I haven't mentioned anything my bio dad has done which is alot but for some reason it's hard to remember the past in order. But everything had made me a nervous shy suicidal wreck until I tried LSD which really helped my look at myself from a different perspective. It didn't fix everything but it did Start me on the road to recovery I'm on now but I struggle still with

A hard time separating love and caring for others from sex

I have sexual thoughts all the time about almost everyone even if I'm not attracted to them

I have trust issues

I have mom and dad issues

I have body image issues

Confidence is a constant struggle

Im hyper sexual but alot of the time in the middle of sex I get bad memories or overthink everything and get anxious and loose it

I feel like everyone secretly hates me even tho I know it's just in my head

My mom and (adopted) dad are both sober and together in a way better place but I find it hard to rebuild that connection even tho they both are great loving people now

And in general I tend to give up on things from fear of rejection

I have trouble keeping friendships cause I go through cycles of being an extrem loner and ghosting to being mega social

As I said in recovering but I'm hoping others will be able to relate so I done feel alone",mentalhealth,2021-01-23 04:41:56

Anyway, I've been having issues lately where I just feel numb and kinda disconnected from the world around me. Usually before I would go to my dad's house and play with the dogs or lay down on my dad's lap till I felt better but I can't do that now so I came up with something new that I feel is weird. I go to the laundry room and put my towel in one if the dryers(the one closest to the wall so it has a corner on one side) and start it. Then I sit on the side of it and rest my back on it. The heat and the gentle rumble of the dryer for some reason helps to make me feel calmer. Not better really but I feel more centered. Depending on how bad it is I will be there for as little as half an hour or for hours on end. And when it's over my towel is warm and I hold onto it because the heat feels nice. The others here keep looking at me weird for doing this so I can't help but wonder, is this weird? Should I not be doing this?

I was an only child and my father has never been in my life. Currently the closest person in my life is my boyfriend but we do long distance. These past few months have been one of the hardest for me and it’s affected my lifestyle. Since I’m a full time student on zoom who lives alone I’ve been able to completely stop taking care of myself without anyone really noticing. I’ve stopped showering, brushing my hair teeth exercising and cleaning my apartment and I got my first F in a fucking dance class because I never bothered showing up. My days are spent lying in bed and ordering Uber eats. 
This is the opposite of who I used to be as I always took pride in wearing full face makeup and putting an attractive foot forward to the world. 
Earlier today I got an email from my landlord who lives next to me saying that bugs have been coming out of my apartment and she had to hire and exterminator for her place as they have entered her apartment. 
I’m utterly mortified that I let my depression get this bad. I’ll have to bug bomb my apt and then make up a story about how a plant died or something instead of telling her I was too depressed to pick up the Chinese food off the counter. 
Beyond being mortified the email was just another blow to my confidence making me feel even more depressed. I feel like I can’t  escape it. I feel alone and abandoned in this world and my only support system (my boyfriend) can be harsh and judgmental. He comes from a devout Muslim family in Pakistan and when I try to open up to him about my pain he shuts me down and makes comments that make me revert further into my depression. 
A few years back I went to the psychiatric doctor and he tested out a bunch of meds on me but nothing ever worked so I stopped going.

I have an issue that comes up from time to time and it lasts months/years. Basically, I can't bring myself to do anything. I have some worries about money/future but I am not depressed - my life is good. 

I want to be productive, I am excited about learning new things, programming, illustrating - **but only in my head**. When I start doing stuff, it's killing me inside. I am spazzing - move in the chair, get up and sit back down, drink water every 5 minutes, and things like that - and I can't focus at all. There are days where this does not happen and I've tried to note down what I'm doing those days to see if there is anything that might influence my mental state but there is nothing.

I tried various studying techniques, tried exercising in between sessions to get rid of the extra energy, I've switched my schedule around a billion times to find something that works for me but nothing helped and I'm out of ideas.

I love life and I'd love it even more if I could just do things that I love without having them feel like a chore.

Anyway what I wanted to ask, through this mental and psychological wandering, is if it’s normal (or if it happened to u for example) to when u stop meds and take it out of your organism some of the “side effects” u got with the treatment disappear and u easily get back to what u were.

I don't have anyone who understands what I'm feeling like, and even my therapist thinks that I lack commitment and will to do basic things like eating and brushing my teeth but it's so hard -- I try to but there are other days when my body is heavy and my mind feels like it's EVERYWHERE at the same time, always; when I try to do something, just one thing, I automatically think that I should be doing something else, and then I'm doing five things at the same time, totally desperated to complete them simultaneously. At the end, I give up and scroll reddit or youtube, even when I want to do something.

Depression, Anxiety, Paranoid Schizophrenia:

I have always known I had depression and severe social anxiety. Long story short, shy kid grew up in an abusive home, got the fuck beat out of him for 18 years, had both parents leave at 15 y/o, became a single parent in high school to provide the best for elementary age younger siblings, fell to alcoholism and addiction at 14/15 to cope with these things stated...
Tried to leave at 18, but my elementary aged siblings and mom got beat, and people went to jail. I was a thousand miles away and couldn’t mediate anymore. I died inside. I moved back. I continued mediating. 
Now it’s 6 years later. 

TLDR————-Throughout everything you just read, I had both audio and visual hallucinations, along with nightmares, sleepwalking, sleep talking, the severe anxiety, and depression. I’ve never told anyone about the hallucinations until about 4 weeks ago, since I finally started seeing a therapist (took about 6 months with the therapist to get to this point of sharing). Therapist and psychiatrist believe paranoid schizophrenia, and it’s what I always was afraid it might be, so it’s really difficult to process. 
Does anyone here have that? There’s so much stigma associated with it. What is the rest of my life supposed to look like? How do I deal with this? I feel better knowing my assumptions weren’t crazy to think....but I worry with what my impulses tell me to do. I worry one day I may do what they say.

What is your biggest challenge in rehab or therapy? 

What is currently the most helpful aspect of your therapy? 

What else would be helpful for you in therapy? 

Are you someone having therapy or a therapist?

I think I want to get help, so why do I never reach out? I can't talk about it with my family, nor do i really want them to know. They just openly criticize me and call me lazy. How have they not noticed? Do the just not care that there once happy son just now looks so hollow? Maybe because it's gone on so long, they've forgotten how I used to be.

A girl I went to school with 2 schools ago, 3 years ago just committed suicide last week. 
It’s extremely shocking and I’m shocked at myself as to why I’m feeling so affected by it. 
We weren’t that great friends. But I always remember her being kind to me and always saying, “Hey Blake!”
As a semi suicide survivor myself, it hurts me that she would of been in the same place and hurting so much that she was successful. 
But what is really bugging me is what my Dad said. 
My Dad is friends with her Dad, for over 20 years now. 
And we were talking about her suicide. 
And my Dad goes, she seemed to have her life together. 
Now my Dad is actually very very emotionally intelligent and understands a lot about suicide and why people do it. 
But we were just talking about it. 
And my Dad says in these kind of words 
“It’s not like she had done something terrible to her family or something that she felt couldn’t be repaired and she should kill her self, like stealing from them” 
He looked me in the eyes for 2 seconds  when he said this. 
I stole from my family. 
I’m not proud of it. 
I did it because of my anger at the situation my parents had put me in. 
These are all excuses but yeah. 
If you look at my previous posts you can see I have a lot of issues with my family. 
But I am working to pay them back, and feel deep regret. 
But wow. 
I didn’t realise he thought that. 
Idk I guess I’m just a bit confused by him saying that.",mentalhealth,2021-01-23 07:38:08

I (29F) made the decision to completely open up to my world about living with bipolar disorder.  I'm talking people at work, all of my social media, family &amp; friends. For me, it was the right time to do this and I'm extremely happy about my decision because of the story I am about to share.

The whole reason I opened up is to help in the fight of bringing awareness to mental health. I've found that the more we talk about it and normalize it, the easier it is for people to feel comfortable seeking the help they need. And if I can help one person with their struggle then that is all that matters to me.

Since revealing it on instagram, SO many people have reached out to me, thanking me for opening up about it and then sharing their stories of struggle with me. So I knew what I was doing was making a difference.

What I didn't know was that my first cousin (27F), someone so near and dear to my heart, was reading my posts and struggling with her own demons. I noticed that she was liking pictures and quotes, but I didn't think too much of it.

And then her older sister reached out to me, in a panic, and told me that my cousin had just opened up to her and her dad about having suicidal thoughts and she wanted to get help. Not to worry- they set her up an appointment and she is doing okay right now. She doesn't know I know, but since finding out this information out my posts have been indirectly aimed at her, and it has inspired me to keep going with this even more.

So what I am trying to say here is that I have seen FIRST HAND how powerful sharing our stories of mental health can be. And I understand and respect that people need to open up in their own time, and some people may never completely open up which is okay too! 

But I have chills as I write this out because to hear from people that my words and vulnerability are making them feel less alone and giving them the push to get help- just validates that what I am doing is the right thing. And to think I could have helped save my cousin's life is the what is giving me the motivation to keep posting and sharing my story.

I am feeling extremely grateful today and I had to share with the world.",mentalhealth,2021-01-23 07:48:43

I horribly hate myself and my life. I question if my friends are really my friends all the time. Most of my friends have just outright stopped talking to me all together. My parents are extremely verbally abusive (Constantly yelling and fighting with each other and I) and they always make stuff up that I 'apparently' did, when I never actually did so. My parents actually make me question my own memory because of this. I don't think my parents are bad people, I just think they are bad parents. They make me feel like shit every day, and every time things start going better with them, they always just find something to yell at me about or just argue. My brother is no better, he genuinely hates me and I know it, he refuses to talk to me, but I fear that he also is going through a lot of stuff as well. School kills me in every way, the stress from being in high classes and having high expectations hurts me so much. People at school are also the worst, I am constantly being bullied for having red hair and being annoying. I can't find anywhere I can fit in. I want to kill myself, I really do, but I cant. My parents say that Suicide is the most selfish thing anyone can do, which makes me more scared about it. I wish I never had parents like mine, but then again, I cant find myself leaving them. I ran away from home once before, and my parents acted all loving and caring in front of everyone in public. But as soon as we got home, I was instantly yelled at and told off. I cant leave my parents cause I'm just a teenager, and I cant leave them because it would hurt me too much to do so.

I have been overworking myself for over a year non-stop and I started feeling so tired. I still study A LOT and have no idea what to do. A week ago, I got 98 from one of my tests, and cried over that, feeling I still wasn't good enough and even had thoughs that I was worthless. I talked to my teachers about this. They all said that I should take a break from studying. And the thing is, the reason why I make 1-2 mistakes is that I panic a lot as well. We had an exam which had 130 questions, I was the top of class with 2 mistakes and guess what? I cried again, but this time it was much much worse. I had thoughs about suic*de but didn't actually consider it. (Thankfully) When I talk to my friends and teachers about this, they always say that i should treat myself like a human, not a robot. And I should stop torturing myself. But am I, really? I dont feel like it. I am Fine, I really am. But I also feel like they are right. I still have not experienced burnout, but that's because I push myself to not let anyone know the situation. So I just act like this is fine. When I talk to my teachers, one of them (ill call him Mr. M) was my fave and when we talked he made me realise that this was getting out of hand. Mr. M said ""You are doing fine. You really have to take a break. You are good enough and please dont make yourself sad, you really are my favorite student."" That was when I realised that this was all in my head and I was just making up a reality. But its still like this. I can't get out of my own thoughts, nor can I stop studying.

I can say I am in a very difficult position, I am a student in Greece, last year in my University and 6 months before join the army for 9 or 12 months. My problem is that I want to ride, to have my own motorcycle and ride, go out alone, without having anyone telling me to drive him/her somewhere or everything else. As a student i used to live for the last 4 years alone in a place far from my home, my parents only sented me some money for the house and for me, I had a job there as a bartender until this fcking pandemic, until there i had my own money, I could support myself and I keep some money for things i want to buy or do. When this pandemic started, I lost my job, just like many others, and had no money for anything, i went back to my parents home, i left my house in the city I used to live because all the lessons are now online and i don't need to pay for an empty house. Now i live with my parents, watching my university ‘s lessons/courses and work with them as I can. The problem is that for the past three years im waiting for the time to end with university, collect some money and buy myself i motorcycle that i want soooooooo badly, now i have no income and my expenses are not so much, my parents cover them, in six months i have to go to military for maximum a year and then come back and start work without this pandemic sht, collect some money and buy this moto. I don't want to wait that long anymore, everybody around me tells me to buy a car, everyone of them prefers to watch me driving a car rather than riding a motorcycle, and I know this makes sense, all my relatives want me to stay safe but duuuuude, it's not about physical safety, its about my mental health. The first year alone I ‘ve been through hard depression, I though i didn't the life i live and i wanted to kill myself, i never have the courage to try but i wanted it, i wanted someone to kill me, to save someone from a car going towards him/her and for this car to hit me and kill me. A year passed, i did a surgery to my knee, i was so fcking alone in there, i had nobody, no friends or family to support me, my family only supported me with money but nothing else, the truth is that they didn't knew anything cause we alomost never talk for nothing, 2 calls per week “Are you ok?”, “All good mom, what about you?”, “All good here too” these where our phone calls. after the i threw my phone and started crying cause i am alone. I’ve through all this sht for a year and came back a little stronger and every month since then(September 2017) i feel so much stronger and confident than the last one. Coming back to the main theme, this is why i want so badly to have a bike more than any other vehicle, i want to be alone, i can't have my personal space at home, work, i live right outside of a big city now and i have no way to move to see my friends, my gf or anyone else, i have to take a taxi and i don't to pay taxi for these. Hope you understand what im saying, i want my personal vehicle, to be alone, go whenever i want alone and don't have anyone to tell me “Go get your sister from there” or “Go home take what i forgot to take cause i bored and you got a car” i don't want all these, i want to move alone and don't have to pick anyone i don't want to. My father tells me if want a car he ‘ll buy my one even tomorrow but i don't care, if i get a car i’ll be the taxi driver of the family and i want some thing to move alone, i’ll say it again, I WANT TO BE ALONE, I DON'T WANT OTHERS TO ASK ME FOR THINGS I **DON'T WANT TO DO**. I don't have any income, nobody supports my decision to ride a motorcycle and nobody seems to understand what im sayng about being alone, i don't want to live with others, i want to live alone, i want to move alone, i want to do things alone, nobody seems to understand that and they tell me things like “Why you need motorcycle?”, “I don't want you to get hurt”, “If you ride i’ll never sleep again cause i’ll always be anxious about you” what they are doing now is so much worse than leaving me alone do what i want. With all this pandemic sht i lost so much money from work, cant do nothing, my priority is to buy a motorcycle and everyone is against me. Every one want to see me safe. But not happy??? I don't know how a mother/father/sister/ uncle is looking at this situation but with all this pressure i am not happy, i’ll be happy right when i’ll be alone, in my home, riding my motorcycle, i don't care, I want to be alone as hell, i want to communicate with everyone but when **I and only I**  want to. 

I really appreciate you for reading till here, i don't need a solution or something or someone’s mercy, i just wanted to tell this and feel a little better. Have a great day and smile, it makes you look way more beautiful!!",mentalhealth,2021-01-23 08:03:28

Recently some recurring dreams have come back to haunt me, and they make it so i cant, or at times dont want to go back to sleep. Why are these dreams that i havent had in 2 years coming back now? I dont understand how I was doing ok, managing being a single parent, doing well at work, and then BAM! My sleep is gone. 

Any ideas as to why this happens? This isnt my first ""relapse"" either, i just dont understand it. 

Any advise is appreciated. 

Disclaimer: I have reached out to mental health, but the VA is slow and sluggish and the first available appointment is still weeks away. My coping mechanisms that I learned in therapy arent working.

Over the past month I got quite ill, losing 10kg in 5 weeks and also having a 2 year relationship end. I’m feeling okay with it all but it definitely still has taken a toll, I think more because my ex was a large support in my life and now that’s gone I don’t really have anyone to confide in. She’s still a good friend but still, not the same.

I’ve started seeing my psych again so I can get some guidance because I am determined not to fall back into the hole I was in years ago. I guess you all know that mental health never goes away fully. I have good and bad days, today is just not great.

I'm suffering from them since I waas 15. Now I'm 21. It first started with social anxiety, I'd say, then because of the issues the social anxiety gives the depression came and then complete anhedonia, lack of drive, appetite and huge cognitive deficiency making me feel dumb and retarded, mentally as well as physiologically, right now.

And I don't know how to change it, I tried a lot like 10 medications (SSRIs, SNRIs, MAOIs) and right now on a tricyclic antidepressant called Amitriptyline. I also tried socializing weeks daily but it seems that my brain never gets an aha-effect or wow, this it how it works, my brain just doesn't learn any new patterns or cognitions (according socializing, university, knowledge etc. etc.). I also tried 2x depth psychological therapy and right now I'm in a  behavioral therapy.

The Amitriptyline doesn't work neither. It was my first antidepressant after more than 9 months now, I started it on 20th of December 2020. But I also started abusing Kratom daily since October 2020 and Phenibut since 3 weeks daily now as without it I wouldn't be able to function in the traineeship for my university which I am in right now. I start thinking about maybe those are the reasons I don't get effects from the Amitriptyline. Also regarding the antidepressants I tried before I always was abusing alcohol at first, then some years later phenibut and now kratom daily. The first 4 antidepressants I had I didn't use any substance at all (not even alcohol/nicotine) but I also didn't get any effects. 

All is fucked up: my brain chemistry my thinking my body. I feel retarded and dumb, mentally as well as physiologically. I don't know what to say in social events, I can't open up myself and feel free or be myself. I can't keep or learn new knowledge, I can't focus at all in conversations as well as classes in university. I can't study. I can't stand up in the morning. I can't eat. I can't sleep. I can't make any new friends or make romantic relationships even if all the people I know tell me I'm so good looking but this doesn't touch my self esteem at all. My self esteem, -trust and -value are at zero. I can't find any clear or rational thoughts but countless incredibly painful negative thoughts. And I fuck myself with kratom, phenibut and cigarettes (at least 0.0 alcohol since 2 years and no other drugs). My head and mind feel empty but at the same time over all the place. My hope is getting less and less since I'm fighting since I was 15. I know the reasons due to my depth psychological therapy so this is understood but still nothing changes.

Any suggestions or recommendations for me?

I will continue my behavioral therapy even if never go out with it with knowing something new that helps me. According meds I still have perspective as I think my brain chemistry is so fucked up because of all this years living and thinking like this because of depression and social anxiety. I also know that my depression fucked up my cognition so bad. I already tried: Venlafaxine (Effexor, Trevilor), Escitalopram (Cipralex), Seroquel (Quetiapine), Promethazine =&gt; those were the meds I tried without abusing any substance meanwhile. On daily alcohol abuse starting in the morning: Sertraline (Zoloft), Paroxetine (Paxil) =&gt; then slowly drifted to phenibut meanwhile on: still Paroxetine (Paxil), Duloxetine (Cymbalta), Opipramol, Moclobemide (Aurorix, an MAOI) =&gt; now on 4 months Kratom and 3 weeks of phenibut daily: Amitriptyline (a tricyclic antidepressant).

I also heard about amisulpride helping tons with social anxiety (which was the main source of my depression early in the beginning and it would help me tons with my depression if I didn't have social anxiety). My doc also mentioned pregabalin (Lyrica) and gabapentin at some of the last options but I know those are very addictive.

What other meds could I give a try the next time I'm at my doc? I also (naturally) want to quit phenibut and kratom after my traineeship ends in 2 weeks. I just need it for this time somehow. Phenibut I don't take at the weekends, only kratom. So is there any med that would help me with withdrawal and detox at the same time while improving my mood, drive, cognition and helping me with depression?

What is your opinion? Did most of these meds didn't work because of my abuse of other substances at the same time? Otherwise also the first 4 meds I tried didn't have any effect and I wasn't using any other substance than the antidepressant. I feel very bad about thinking this now, of course. My own fault but I just wanted to live at least 20% rather than 0% and these substances allowed me to do so.

A few months ago, I had consulted a licensed psychologist from my university for mental help. My main concern was PTSD that I suffer with, which basically creates alot of other issues for me as well (such as social anxiety etc). My appointments with the psychologist started and we had 5 sessions. My psychological told/suggested me to wait for at least 6 months after our sessions end, so I can apply whatever coping techniques I've learned and see how I manage on my own. She then suggested that after at least this time period passes, I would be welcome to contact her again for help.

It's been a month since my last session with her and I feel the need to approach therapy again. The reason for that being my slight dissatisfaction with the sessions. The sessions proved to be extremely helpful but I recognize that I was expecting slightly more from them. I feel like just 5 sessions for such a history of complex trauma, isn't enough. I feel like alot more sessions could be needed to truly help me.

I'm confused on whether I should approach therapy (before 6 months after my last session) or not? Another thing worth mentioning is that when my last session got over, I was devastated and scared for two days with the feeling of loneliness. I was having an extreme urge to get help from someone again but as I pushed and encouraged myself to deal with my issues, I got really better and the urge went away. I'm kind of scared and confused on if I should get help now or not because I feel as if I would be deceiving my previous psychologist if I did (as I do plan on consulting her again after 6 months), and I'm also skeptical of getting unhealthily attached and dependant on therapists, to the point of being dysfunctional without them.

If anyone has been through a similar situation as mine, I would be curious to hear their suggestion.",mentalhealth,2021-01-23 10:05:28

The evidence on this has been around since the 1950s - people have always used their relative position against other people as a way of evaluating themselves. Its probably a natural part of the human experience, but problems arise when we’re constantly aware of what other people have and what we don’t have, leaving us dissatisfied with our lives.

The habits of being competitive and comparing ourselves may have built up over generations, so don’t beat yourself up for feeling this way. There isn’t a quick fix to it but there are a few things can help, the first being training your awareness. A little bit of practice every day makes a huge difference and we can use that training to be aware in the moment when that competitive energy is rising. In that moment, shining our awareness and giving that feeling our kindness while we breathe stops us from being swept away and breaks the link between feeling and acting.

The second way is to be grateful for what you have - keeping a log of three things every day of you’re grateful for is a great way to do this. These can be big things like your health, small things like your breakfast or neutral things like the feeling of your feet on the ground as you walk. Taking joy in the world around you is the formula for a happy life.

The last way is spending less time on the things that drive our competitive energy. That might be social media, certain TV programmes or it might be worth rethinking what you want from your career. If the alternative to eternally striving for success is a small, ordinary, happy life - whats wrong with that?

About 8 months ago, I was talking with a friend of mine (bipolar disorder), and she shared with me (bipolar disorder) some interesting information I’d never heard of. She said there was a genetic mutation that causes the great majority of those who have it to be near unresponsive to antidepressants. It’s called the MTHFR gene. Now bear with me, as I’m not a genealogist, but if you do some research, you’ll see that this genetic mutation is actually really common (some estimates are that up to 40% of the population has it). It basically affects how the body metabolizes folate. Some people have one mutated allele (up to 40% decrease in folate absorption), some people have two (up to 70% percent reduction in folate absorption). Personally, I found out I have one mutated allele.

Since I found out about this in August, I began taking methylfolate. This is the already metabolized version of folate, and found at vitamin stores. The difference I’ve seen in my mental health has been like night and day. Before I started taking it, my bipolar disorder looked like (medicated) constant depression with periods of mania that looked more like just the absence of depression. All the medication seemed to be doing was keeping me from killing myself. I was always on the edge, and most days it felt like the medication was doing nothing at all. Since I started taking the methylfolate, my life has completely changed. I am still medicated, but the medication is doing it’s job. I still struggle with anxiety at times, and my mania looks more like a classic mania with increased mood, but it’s manageable. The depression is near gone. I just wish someone would have told me about this sooner.

So if you feel like you’re dealing with medication resistant mental illness, please look into genetic testing. I was able to see mine because I’d already done an one of those hereditary website things and had sent over my results to a genealogy website, so mine was right there to access once I’d heard about this. I just hope this helps someone the way it’s helped me.",mentalhealth,2021-01-23 10:54:20

I've always been more on the active and energetic side, being an extreme extrovert, goofing around, joking and in general just enjoying life.

But lately I've become sort of distanced from people and things. I have a very large circle of friends at school and outside, with whom I'd always talk and do stuff. At school, during the pauses inbetween the lessons I'd always go around, talk to people and just joke with them, share cool stories etc, but I don't do that anymore. I now spend my pauses doing homework and other schoolwork and I only speak to people when spoken to and I try and keep the conversations quick to get back to whatever I am doing. I also used to go out with friends alot to either hangout, play sports or party. I rarely do that now (COVID isn't a big issue in my country right now, so these activities aren't really anything unusual). I also enjoyed playing videogames alot, either by myself or with friends. Now I only play with friends and not for a very long time. I don't know how to feel about this.

My dad says that something is wrong with me or that I hate him since I can’t call him daddy (the term has been so distorted that I don’t like saying it) and since I don’t like touching him. I do hate my dad he is the reason I don’t wanna get out of bed most of the time. My sister just hits me a lot so I don’t like her very much either. My mom is amazing and I love her. 
Another thing is sitting in a dark closet so weird because I find it comforting when crying. And to add on to my dad he hugged me the other day and grabbed my hair and said your hair is so soft and then was confused on as to why I ran away from the hug. I ran away because I felt disgusted and unsafe in the moment it was like my flight or fight reflex.

I've never been very social, and I spent a whole lot of time as a kid imagining myself doing something good and people, like my classmates, for example, would ""see"" it and become more accepting of me. I had this habit of going on long walks/runs at night and I would imagine all of that for hours.

I also imagined them ""seeing"" me put through horrible situations, sometimes real, sometimes real but exaggerated, and sometimes completely made up, and feeling like I am so strong to still be who I am with that type of trauma. Then I shifted to imagining different characters in these same awful scenarios. I would then imagine their peers, or parents, or teachers finding out about the awful aspects of their lives, and then becoming more accepting and sympathetic. I would feel really good about that for some reason.

I think I grew out of this. However, to this day I still have this lingering feeling like someone is always watching me, particularly the people I want to think better of me. Sometimes I feel the need to impress them or show them why I am the way I am. I sometimes talk out loud to myself while imagining these people listening in.

I don't have any bad trauma, which makes me feel especially guilty for imagining people giving me sympathy/respect based on the imagined scenarios. This guilt I think is part of the reason I don't do it anymore.

So basically I don't get along with my mum. It's just that I find her very emotionally draining. She has very, very frequent temper outbursts. She'll basically lash out on me and my sisters for even the tiniest of things. It's like walking on eggshells around her.
The thing is it was not always like this. She was just like other moms are. But since a few years (5-6) she's been very challenging to be around. I've tried finding a pattern, whether it's something particular that pisses her off. It's not. It's just she'll be ok with us/me doing something one time and the next time she'll just lash out. And when I say, 'lash out' I mean proper harsh curse words that honestly I can't even think about. She'll stay stuff like ""I never should've had you,"" etc. And I feel like since I'm the eldest I get the most of it. Also it doesn't help that I'm generally a slightly sensitive person(the kind of person who still gets haunted a week later about how I should've said thanks to the the girl in my class who complimented my name) it's just she's the only person who can make me go from feeling like +100 to a -100. My sisters take it better than me. The one who's a 1 1/2 year younger than me told me she just doesn't let it get to her anymore cause my mum's comments are predictable. The youngest one (she's 12) will get upset at the time but then be totally fine later. I do encourage her to talk about how she's feeling, cause I'm very well aware of how repressed emotions might damage the absolutely adorable person she is. It's just I get so exhausted.
She ALWAYS blames me for being rude. In the beginning it was her calling me rude cause I tended to raise my voice, when she'll be cursing us for legit nothing.Stopped doing that. Then she started calling me rude cause I'll just offer a reasonable response to her. Now I've just completely stopped saying anything when she's lashing out on me/giving me a lecture. now, she thinks I'm rude cause I don't feel ashamed enough to say something in my defense.
Like just today, I had a very tiring day. Had loads of tests slept late last night. So I was just relaxing a bit catching up with the world on my phone. She told me to go study for the tests I had due. Now I'm a Straight-A student. Have been my entire life. Trust me when I say no one worries more about my studies than I do. Me:""mum, don't worry, I'll do it, you don't have to worry about me"". she gets mad,""then who am I supposed to worry about? The neighbor's kid?"" To which without thinking I just did a low 'humm' sound. Dad was there. Now dad is someone who Usually doesn't lash out like mum. But he immediately went into a whole you are so rude to your mum. And mum's just sitting next to him smiling at me(the one where you get happy to get someone in trouble) and going like ""yea I told you she's become so rude. She's not even replying cause she's not even bothered."" Ahhhhhh so events like these (which are 3/day) get me down. Like bad. The one where I cry.

I started venting to people about this and they all said that no I'm not annoying and that I don't drive anyone away. But I started doubting them and my mind just denied any form of support. This has lead to me hating myself to an extent that I started going suicidal. This amount of self doubts is driving me insane. I don't even know why do I feel like this. I get depressed, I seek help, I get the help and yet I still feel like people are only saying this to calm me down or to prevent me from suiciding. I started getting scared of talking to people because I fear they find me annoying. And I've kept all of this inside me. I help a ton of people with their problems, or at least try to..and because I started feelig horrible myself, I can't help them like I usually did and this only makes me feel worse about myself. How do I stop this? How do I stop doubting myself about being hated? 


I'm sorry if this was a mess and that you couldn't understand anything that I said. Then again, I'm horrible at describing my problems. I feel like I wanted to say more but this is everything that's in mind currently.",mentalhealth,2021-01-23 12:24:20

I don't know whether I struggle with my mental health - sometimes I think I do, and sometimes I think I don't. For context I'm what many people would assume to be accomplished, recently became a dentist, I've had a good education and have a good family. I'm 24 (F)

Since around my late teenage years I've intermittently felt this emptiness and loneliness. I have learnt to be open about how I feel with people for self-help purposes but I often feel misunderstood. Sometimes I feel so lost, I don't know who I am. Maybe over the past few years I started dissociating every now and then. Sometimes I get so mad I punch a wall and whilst I know this is self-destructive, there isn't much that can sooth me. I look forward to my life and I can't see a future, I mean don't get me wrong I can't wait to have children and I rely on that changing my life maybe a little too much. I can't guarantee to myself that I'll live a whole life. Don't get me wrong, I'm a high functioning person but my mind is very very clouded at these periods of time even though I'm doing what I have to do.

Sometimes I wake up in the morning and I feel good, I feel positive and I have a great day treating my patients and I feel that they love praising me. And in those moments, I think that it is impossible that I have those periods where I'm hopeless and can't see a future for myself. In those moments it feels almost made up that I would feel that way - there's no way.

I have a S/O in my life and I try to be open but he struggles with understanding, or wanting to listen to me. I'm not sure what I can do to help that, it's getting exhausting feeling misunderstood.

Because of my job circumstances I can't really ask for help because it could jeopardise my career. I was treated for depression from the age of 17+, and came off medication when I turned 22 or around there. I guess I'm really writing this to know whether other people experience this too?

I am a 22yo male who have been diagnosed with ADHD when I was 13 yo (I have been using Concerta for 2 months now bc I realized I can't graduate without some help). From what I recall I didn't use to talk to myself but now I talk to myself 24/7, sometimes in 3rd (he) person sometimes in 1st (I) person and sometimes in 2nd (you) person. I got out of a psychologically traumatizing relationship that lasted a little over a year, 1 year ago.  I thought everything was going fine this past year when I was single but then I started realizing some weird stuff happening mostly when I was high.

I could hear my thoughts coming out of other peoples mouths and not just people next to me but for example a commentator on the TV too. Whenever this happened I would just get out of the room I was in and sit by myself and listen to calming piano beats or something. I did some research on it and thought it could be auditory hallucinations I still think it might be that. Then it started happening when I am sober too. I would be in a room with people and not say a single word, but for some reason other people would be saying things in my head to other people in the room.

An example of this that really bugged me was yesterday after I smoked a little bit, we were talking with some friends when I started to hear my thoughts be the conversation topic of the room. I started thinking damn I think I am too high for this (as in with other people). As I was thinking that my friend who never smokes and didn't smoke yesterday said, as he was looking at me ""Guys I think I am too high for this"". Then I said, I am too high for this, I will be fine but I gotta go and left.

This now happens when I am sober too and I don't know if it's my thoughts that are leaking or I am communicating in a way I don't understand. This doesn't happen when I am talking to someone 1 on 1 but rather happens when I am in a room with bunch of people at the same time.

The screaming was like I was sitting in the wrong place, because she was screaming that she didn’t know the people. I didn’t know them either, which made my heart feel like it was vibrating without me actually breathing on it, I needed to help. They were going to give her the elephant injections, so I tried my best to help. Then they started grabbing me for no reason, they said I was having a panic attack and that I can’t have medication because I’d already had my maximum dose of promethazine and lorazepam, but I just wanted to help. The nurse told me that my friend said  she’s sorry for upsetting me and that they’d already injected her, so there was nothing else i could do because the tv was also off in her room, and they locked me out of the bedroom corridor. I tried throwing stuff at the window to break it, so I could go in to save her from the skin, but then they started dragging me into seclusion. They were holding my wounds really tight and wouldn’t let me go, then they let go of my and ran out of the room and shut the door in my face. I was screaming for 2 hours straight at the window, and they eventually shut the blinds on me, and I had to drink out of the bathroom tap because they said I wasn’t asking nice enough to get water. After a few hours in there, they came in with medication and said if I don’t take it, they won’t let me out - so I took it. Before they let me out, they were saying “why are you trying to hurt us, you enjoy hurting us, you think it’s funny”, and I said that I don’t and I’ll discuss the incident with my psychiatrist in the morning because I was really tired. My parents are coming to visit today, they’re bringing me a new laptop, MP3 player, and some beats headphones so I can listen to music to keep me calm.

I took anti anxiety medication for probably a year but that was it. I'm 22 now and never really known how to define my mental health.

I know for sure that I have social anxiety, however I didn't know what social anxiety was until a couple years ago. I've also been dealing with general anxiety for the past few years. And then for depression I'm not sure. 

I was just reading through my old diaries, which I've kept since I was 13. I was looking at the years 2018-2019 and literally one entry would be me saying stuff like ""I hate myself. I'm ugly, I'm fat. I want to kill myself. I'm hopeless."" and then the next entry would be ""I'm so confident now. I'm really happy at work at the moment."" and then the next entry would be depressing and then the next would be happy and so on. 

This is weird to me because when I think about my past I can't even really remember being ""depressed"". I mean I do remember the major moments, but overall not really. Yet it seems like I had MANY days of feeling really depressed and suicidal. I was on the phone to my mum today and she was talking about how bad of a time I had when I was in high school, saying that she could barely sleep for a year because of how bad I was. I do remember that I had some rough periods but I never remember it being THAT bad. I think part of this might be cause I tend to think that I'm making up my problems. This is also why I have never been able to define myself as ""having depression"" as I seem to be fine often, but then depressed over times. So what is that? Is that still depression, or is it normal to fluctuate like that? It would range anywhere from days to weeks. I don't think it's anything like bipolar as I'm not manic or whatever I just go from being depressed to just being fine/happy. I've had a good few months recently though. Last summer I had a few periods of being extremely depressed, suicidal, and anxious, but I haven't felt that way recently as I started taking St Johns Wort in July, which didn't start showing effects until Oct-Nov ish. However I do pretty much always get depressed and suicidal when I have a drink, no matter what.

Ive been told that high moods are a symptom of depression, and that that may be what I'm suffering from. But I've never heard of that with clinical depression. So if anyone has experienced depression with the high mood I'm going to describe it would mean a lot to me if you'd rech out as Id like to learn more about it.

 So I've been diagnosed with depression for maybe 3 years but over the last year I'd say it has gotten increasingly worse. I have had cbt but as my mood swings aren't really affected by anything environmental or my thinking it wasn't very effective. I have also taken antidepressants but I feel that these have made no difference except worsening my depression.
 In May I also suffered from an episode that I'll refer to as a ""high mood"". It's important to note that for me this wasn't just a good mood, it felt like how I'd imagine a drugs high would, and at times I felt so high it was almost uncomfortable. It felt good but I knew something wasn't right. This lasted about a week and consisted of me feeling almost euphoric, having an excess of energy, tons of ideas for now art projects, way higher self esteem and a sense that I was invincible. Towards the end of the week I began to feel frustrated as I couldn't get anything done with my mind going so fast, and also incredibly agitated from all the excess energy. This mood change was preceeded and followed by intense depression. I spoke to my doctor and I was temporarily given a diagnosis of bipolar 2, and was set to change from my antidepressants (fluoxetine) to a suitable antipsychotic. After a couple of days however I was told that they felt they had been too hasty with the diagnosis and treatment, and that bipolar 2 can't be diagnosed in under 18s? (I'm 17 1/2). So my diagnosis was changed back to depression and I was put on a new antidepressant (sertraline).  They said that if I had had a full blown manic episode then they would have been treated straight away. Which makes me feel like the only way I'll receive some answers and treatment is if I have a manic episode, or end up in hospital from depression. Also makes me feel like Im gonna have to wait months until I'm 18 to actually get the right treatment, which feels ridiculous to me. They had previously said that the high mood seemed like a hypomanic episode, but following them changing my diagnosis back to depression, I was told it was just a ""blip"" .which makes me feel like how many more ""blips"" do I have before I get taken seriously? 

Well come late December, and I had another episode of the high mood, following the same pattern as last time of depression, euphoric/angry mood and then back to severe depression. I don't feel like it's down to medication as I have had an near identicle experience, 8 months apart, on two different meds. Bearing in mind the first high happened after I had been on fluoxetine for over a year. . Anyway so the last few weeks I have desperately been trying to get in contact with my doctor because my mood swings were horrendous and I didn't feel that my meds were helping. but with no luck as they're off work and I havnt been put in contact with a replacement. I've rang up many times and have been told that I would receive a phone call back as it was urgent but I never did. So that led me to decide to come off sertraline myself, which I'm now feeling the withdrawal of lol. Anyway I'm looking into seeing a new psychiatrist who may be able to confirm a diagnosis and treatment for me so hopefully that can happen soon.

In the span of a few months, I was diagnosed with a whole bunch of stuff. I’ve come to terms with it now, but it sucked back then.

I was really struggling, but I held onto hope that I could still achieve success. But then, I realized I was underprepared for college. My parents, friends and counselors were either too busy or didn’t know how to help me apply and by the time I realized it, I had no choice but to join a community college. My ex dumped me right before the first semester and I was sent to a psychiatric hospital right after a suicide attempt. I should have stayed longer and tried to heal but I had to rush myself out and get to school. It didn’t matter in the end, though, cause I ended up dropping out a few months in.

I planned to use this time to get my license, find a job and get some experience in before I went and applied for college the next year, but then corona happened and, well, things were ruined.

My mother got a liver transplant in 2017 which makes her highly vulnerable to the virus so that means I couldn’t get a job or get a driving instructor. I got my permit, but my parents are both either too busy or don’t care enough to teach me. I tried time and time again to research and apply for college but, because I’m only good at art and music (at a very amateur level, I should say), It’s been a struggle trying to compile all the things I would need to submit.

I had a therapist and psychiatrist that I found to help me out during these trying times where I barely leave my room and pretend to be happy for my parents but, because of financial problems, I can’t bring myself to keep using my parent’s money to pay for them.

It sometimes feels like I’m a prisoner in a tower like in the fairytales, but I’m not sure how much I can take waiting for a happy ending of any kind to just happen. If I go outside, I endanger my mom and get yelled at. If I stay inside, I rot like I already am. It doesn’t help that all my friends have moved on passed me and I’m stuck scrambling to get in contact with them, even just casually.

I’d say things suck, because in our current situation it does, but I’m not sure saying anything good or bad will really do much right now. It all just feels numb. I don’t want to die, but I don’t want to live. All I can do is sit and wait.",mentalhealth,2021-01-23 14:05:13

My girlfriend (who lived with me during the first part of the pandemic) is now studying abroad and will be back not before the middle of March. I am in a city where I have very few friends (maybe 2-3) and in furlough (I am studying too) so every day is too long and seems the same. I am getting kind of depressed, I cannot leave the council area I’m living in and also the gyms are shut. I am trying to force myself to study, to workout inside the house, etc. but I feel lazy and cannot focus at all when studying. I’m not just missing my girlfriend but human contacts in general. The idea of calling a friend, learning an inside hobby etc. won’t help because I feel bored of staying inside. Anyone experiencing the same feeling? How do you deal with this? Does anything make you feel better?

I was used to met and deal with plenty of people, both at work and outside of it. My life was going well and now it is completely different.

I’m still paranoid, anxious about everything, I struggle to go to work, and I’ve distanced myself from my family. Ive tried getting closer but when something goes wrong I distance again. I just have a constant stream of anxiety and trying to keep everything under control. 

It just feels like... ever since the initial breakdown my mind has been shattered 
And I’ve been trying to fix it while doing my best not to let my family know. I feel so broken like I can’t play my part anymore. Like I can’t pull myself back together for long enough before breaking again bc of the damage. Suddenly everything that was ok isn’t.

As of June of 2020, I've suspected that I have some mental health issues that make it hard to perform basic tasks (cleaning, studying, etc) as well as a form of social anxiety. So far I've done well in learning about mindfulness and other treatment options, as well as just more about myself and my limits in general, and I can say that I've made small but noticeable improvements concerning my health and overall well-being.

That is until a couple of days ago. Each night for 3 night in a row I've been suffering from extremely hard hitting bouts of depression and self depricating thoughts and havent gotten more than ~10 hrs of sleep collectively across the past 3 days. I feel that I've been functionally depressed for ~5 years now, however I was still able to overcome it enough for me to manage it. I've had similar moments like this in the past, but they usually blow over in the morning and have never been this severe before. 


I used to enjoy walking with my dog out in nature and but because of my work schedule I would sometimes have to go at night, which wasnt bad, but I typically would prefer daytime hours. Today is my first day off in 4 days, but I found myself feeling tortured by the sunlight this morning; I was literally angry upon seeing the sun. I've since blocked my windows and doors to my room, and I'm currently sitting in complete darkness, peacefully.

This is all so new and I really thought I would be back to feeling normal by now but I'm not and its really stressing me out. I dont have money for literally any type of mental health treatment, its not, never was, and probably never will be an option for me, and because of that I feel hopeless.

I’m 26F UK 
I’m really not sure if it’s worth me making an appointment with my GP or if I need to bring myself to “snap out of it”. I feel really silly for writing all of this down but I don’t feel “right”, mentally. If it is worth mentioning, I’m on a contraceptive pill (microgynin) and I have an under active thyroid which I take medication for. 

At 16-18 I used to suffer with anxiety &amp; panic attacks to the point I would forget where I was (daily route) and become forgetful in general causing myself to get so worked up and upset during these confusing episodes. I would Frequently get daily heart palpitations too and so I went to the GP who said it was Anxiety. I never really did anything and it sort of calmed down. The dr was just Blunt about it and didn’t really offer any resources. 

Present day and for the last couple of years or so, I’m finding myself feeling down almost all the time, I can’t even reason with myself as to why. I have a great partner, home, salary etc but I just don’t realise it. It’s got to the point that everyday tasks, I.e. brushing teeth or hair or generally taking better care of myself feels like such an overwhelming task. I have to talk myself and cluster (what feels like) a LOT of energy to do the most basic things. I have to force myself to go out for a walk. I feel good whilst doing it but then I get home and I’m back to feeling like I can’t go out again or I need to recharge. For the record daily I do groom but it doesn’t feel like I do it as part of my regime. 

I get heart palpitations a lot again, for no reason. I get nervous and get them when I get a message that a delivery is expected to my door at a certain time. I’ve started to get forgetful again and misplace things that I had not long before. I had £20 the other day and then i just couldn’t find it. I looked everywhere and then an hour later it was where I first had it. I was home alone but I just couldn’t understand why I didn’t see it the first time round. 

My friends text me sometimes and I’ve just ignored them on occasions. I have a response in my head but I find it hard to put it on messenger and carry on the conversation. 

I feel tired a lot, I have gained 50lbs in the last 3 years and I know I need to do something but I just don’t feel
Motivated enough. I don’t know what it is that makes me feel this way, I can’t explain it. It’s like a constant blocker that takes so much energy to knock down each time. 

I’m sorry for rambling on, this has been on my mind for a while but I’m not sure whether this is depression or something I need to over come by myself?",mentalhealth,2021-01-23 15:31:55

It doesn't happen everyday and doesn't usually limit things I can do, which I guess is good. But when I start thinking about it, I can't stop. That day is ruined for me. I guess it started a while ago, when I was 10 or 11. When I was 8, my mom died. I was only in 3rd grade so there was a lot of distractions and stuff. When people asked me about it I'd truthfully say I was fine. Then I went to 4th grade and it was and still is the time of my life. I don't know why but it was everything. I was always hanging out with my friends (who were way older bcz no one my age could go outside) and going to the park. When I wasn't doing that I'd be going places with my family. Even school was fun. Then 5th grade came and things stopped. I played more video games but I would still hang out with my friends alot. During these 2 years I probably wasn't fine, I'd still cry about my mom. Then I had to go to middle school and this is where it started. Not one of my friends could go outside, so I'd have have to play video games with them. The one redeeming thing about this was school because at least that was fun.  With the pandemic, there is no school or going outside. Right now, everything redeemable about my life was 10x better when I was 10-11 or when my mom was here.) I don't think about this everyday, but when I do, my day is ruined and I feel like shit. It makes me think that nothing in the foreseeable future can ever be as good as things that happened 4 whole years ago. Im going into high school, but I'm going to one where I'll probably have to study the whole day, so that doesn't make it any better. Is there any people who have dealt with something similar?

Most of the stuff that still affects me is memories of high school. Now I am a 22 year old man, working a great job and I have a relatively stable life. It wasnt always that way. I used to be a compulsive liar in a really bad way. It stemmed from my insecurities and for most of my life people didnt care or didnt notice. High school was where it actually surfaced as an issue. I met this girl who I became best friends with in that period of time. We can call her K. We talked daily and actually got really close. That was during my freshman year and frankly it was the only decent year of high school I had. Freshman year rolled into sophomore year and her and i joined the same gym class. Within that class was this girl who we will call D. D and i hit it off because a classmate was hitting on her and we joked about it privately. From there we began talking and later on she expressed a romantic interest in me. 

I have never been particularly successful with romantic affairs. I'm a shy person with issues with physical insecurities and on top of that i had a family who always infantilized and made light of relationship endeavors. When she expressed that interest i felt a mutual attraction. The only issue was that she had a boyfriend and even though she wasnt happy with the relationship she felt too guilty to break up with him because of some medical issues. Cue me being a fuckin idiot and not sticking to a more principled lifestyle. We ended up making out a bit, nothing much to her but to an insecure and sheltered teenage boy it was big. I ended up investing a lot of effort and hope into it. Few weeks go by of us playing around and she decides that she just wants things to be platonic. On the surface i was alright but subconsciously i was upset. Instead of dealing with it healthily what do i do? Make up a fake girlfriend, complete with a fake phone number and everything. I even made up an elaborate story of how i lost my virginity to her.

 While this was happening K was watching. We were close, but definitely not as close as before. I noticed the seeping's of disgust and disbelief making its way into the friendship because she saw what i was doing. Before K I had no women friends. I literally had 1 friend who i fell out with the year before high school because he was a bully. She was the first person who had treated me with dignity, kindness and an emotional spectrum that didn't include pity or annoyance. I relied on her considerably. Things took a total nosedive when she began to not text back. It went from daily conversations to multiple texts before a response. Around here i got engulfed by the lies. i forgot what i was telling people and would have to double down so that the house of cards didn't fall. she was smarter than that and saw through it. 

The events I've described now have occurred over the span of around September of that year to the March of the following year. Within that time D started suffering from Seasonal Affective Disorder and started suffering from suicidal ideation. I hadn't been taught how to set boundaries, how to be empathetic without trying to emulate them. She became suicidal, i followed with, and during that time i began clawing anyone i possibly could down with me. Every friendship i gained during my freshman year evaporated. They were tired of putting up with the bullshit. K began distancing herself while I wallowed around in my realm of self pity and bitterness with D. The year begins to wrap up and somehow I tentatively repair  friendships with the group whos friendships paused. K and I still are on unsteady, leaning more towards acquaintances and then summer hits. My mom gives me some passive aggressive comment about how D isnt healthy for me and if i wanna blame her for why i shouldn't be friends with her i can. i saw that as the last life raft on the sinking ship that was my high school life but i chicken out and ghost D. I ghost someone i was madly in love with after being close for over a year. Halfway through that summer K and and my friendship finally just collapsed and we had several big fights before not talking for the better part of 2 years. 

So that puts us at now. I am an outwardly successful person with all the bells and whistles of the American dream. Inwardly I havent moved on from that year in a lot of ways. I used to be an insanely chipper person, always happy and extroverted. Now I am completely the opposite. I prefer being alone, I prefer staying home and watching movies. I cant open up to people emotionally. Hell, I'm not even emotionally honest with myself. I derive no pleasure from sex, or romantic encounters. I hold absolutely everyone in my life at a distance. It feels like I am a being in a space suit thats controlled by someone else. The majority of me has become complacent with living my life entirely apart from everyone.

For all my life, I have hated the thought of being forgotten when you die or just the simple idea of your soul drifting into the loneliness of the universe when the last person that remembers you dies. My problem is that I can't stop thinking about this. During the past few days, I could not stop thinking about this. I have been sad all the time, and I can’t focus on anything else. 
This had only gotten worse when I recently discovered old photo albums and diaries from my grandfather. All the people who are now forgotten about: it makes me so sad that I don't know who they are and what they did. In addition to that, I feel like my grandfather was not fully happy with his life and it makes me really sad that I can't talk to him anymore and tell him that I value what he did (was 11 years old when he died). I also found out more about my ancestors, but this made me even sadder. Again, I have the same problem. Forgotten people who live or have lived worldwide and who I will never be able to talk to.
I think that everyone has thought about this in their life to some extent, but I have to problem that I think about this 24/7. Cooking, studying, workout, it doesn't matter. 
I hope that my “problem” came across clearly.”
Does anyone have similar issues? 
Any advice?

I'm just venting and sharing my personal thoughts on who I am as a person which is the fault of my environment and myself. 

Where do I even begin...

\- Got verbally bullied when I was 13

Caused self-esteem issues and I never self-harmed before that so I guess that played a part. Though I don't self-harm anymore, I did occasionally in high school. I'm kind of socially anxious, especially when it comes to guys (the bully was male). Hence, I don't really have male friends. Though looking back, I was obnoxious as a kid, he probably rightfully knocked me down a peg. But that didn't really justify it all, kids deal with shit in weird ways, 

\- Professional bridge burner

Following the point on friends, I cut of a couple friendships like so cleanly I literally burned the bridge and never looked back. I don't even know what to say about that, I realise that I have a problem maintaining relationships. 

\- Spoiled

As an only child, I was spoiled and never really taught where the boundaries were. I would push them to get a reaction and usually I would say things that would borderline funny and mean. Don't get me wrong, I was given punishments. Can't really remember what for but for certain things, I would be physically punished. 

\- An emotional mess

My mood swings are worse than a pendulum. Probably one at 2x speed. I would have screaming matches with my mom in high school. It might have been the hormones but I still am unable to control my emotions. There's not much control in my life, especially self-control and discipline. I hate the way I come off though, to my neighbours who heard the fighting all those years. I know I'm not the worst person in the world, but I hate to think that they perceive me as an ungrateful, hateful bitch. 

\- My never-ending flaws

I'm stubborn, selfish, unhealthy, impatient, sensitive, constantly overthinking, procrastinating and worrying. Listing them out at the start of this year, I realised how shitty of a person I am. But I know that's not all of me. I'm also smart, hardworking, kind, helpful, polite, creative, and highly empathetic. (Trying to think of positive things... not very easy) But yea, I know I'm not just a piece of shit. At least not completely. Some of the traits seem contradictory... yea I don't know, it could be situational or just the complexities of a messed up personality. 

\- Constantly looking for what's actually wrong with me 

Right now, I'm thinking I might have ADHD, maybe the inattentive type. I get distracted so much that sometimes I don't even bother. With studies if it's a subject I didn't like, I could start on homework but then start doing something else and not end up doing anything productive. I daydream a lot too, it's extremely easy for me to zone out if I look at one spot for a while. It used to happen a lot more in primary school (7-12) when I created a whole world in my head and started buildings stuff for example, all while looking at a notice board. Also my mood swings and overthinking which I touched on earlier. 

I also have a terrible memory. I have about five memories of my childhood and I completely forgot everything about a holiday I went on when I was 10 aside from one or two things. I also have this thing where I cannot remember birthdays. I'm not really sure what my mom's is and I never remembered my friend's at all. I've been friends with this girl for over 5 years and the only thing I'm confident about is that her birth month starts with Ju-.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't even know. Sorry for the people who read the 5am ramblings of a teen who's extremely messed up. I actually really apologise, because I should be unloading on my counsellor instead but sessions are a bit slow and we're still at the beginning (getting-to-know) kind of phase, if you get what I mean. I don't even know what this is, sorry.",mentalhealth,2021-01-23 16:29:59

I'm the only male in my household so it lead to lots of isolation once I reached the ages of about 13/14 all up until now. I felt completely different than my siblings. I've vented to my mom about past emotional problems (anger issues, I had mild auditory delusions a couple times) but for the past while I've just been acknowledging how numb I am to life. 

When I say absolutely nothing brings me any form of excitement or genuine happiness I mean *nothing*. I can only assume my years of surpressing everything lead to this overwhelming feeling. I can sense my happiness, joy, my passion for caring and my huge heart that I once had deep down inside, locked away in a dark corner. I know it's still in me but I'm absolutely hopeless that it will ever come back to me. Now I'm sad, give up easily, sensitive, numb, angry, beaten up and anti social. I'm sick of putting on a happy front so nobody asks me how I'm feeling. I hate been spoken to now, I just want to be left alone. 

Today is the first day I really felt overwhelmed to the point I wanted to ask for help but something inside really takes grip of me and makes me think these fake rational thoughts (I know that doesn't make sense, but it seems rational at one point but then my subconscious kicks in, takes over and makes me feel like asking for help over my situation is being weak). It's a constant back and forth battle with myself feeling like I'm drowning to feeling even worse by thinking I can't deal with such a minor issue. 

The only release I get is listening to music, at least that way I can hear other people express how I'm feeling. It's better to hear it out loud, that way it feels like I'm venting because i have nowhere to do that myself. My dad practically shamed me and made me feel embarrassed for going to a psychiatrist for my previously mentioned mental health issues.",mentalhealth,2021-01-23 16:46:24

As for me...I am struggling today. It is VERY cold out today and it has been snowing off and on, so I just feel trapped in these 4 walls. My anxiety is spiking, which it only does occasionally. I am OK for now--I can deal with this now that I have something else to focus on (the bird and the egg she has laid with possible more eggs coming).

I feel like my honesty hides a lot of darkness and some truth. I think often when I feel I have nothing to lose I become hyper honest. Like ""I'm going to die anyway"" or ""they won't do anything"" so I'll tell them loads.

I'll tell them loads but I won't tell them everything. I once told a doctor about how I was thinking about this apparently foolproof way to kill myself I didn't tell her that I also currently had a plan that I could and was going to carry out within the next hour. 

I've told them so much that they think that must kind of be everything but actually theres a lot of stuff that I've never told anyone like how at one point in my life i didn't consider myself human, that I know I'm going to kill myself one day it's just a matter of how long I last, that I think I might have hallucinations, that at one period in my life I planned to murder a bunch of people, that I'd be happy if I were dead right now.

Sometimes the honesty isn't good though. Certain doctors (usually ones who don't specialise in mental health) are pretty horrid when you tell them about your mental illness although I probably don't have to tell anyone here that.

My dad left my mum when I was 10, still saw him but she wouldn’t let me for 6 months. Which I don’t even remember so I don’t know if I blocked it out or what. Then my mum turned out to be an abusive alcoholic. So I was abused for years. We had to live with my grandparents for a while when I was a teenager and I had to share a room with her and it was horrible. We eventually got our own place and the abuse only got worse to the point she pushed me one night. Then finally at age 20 I get the courage to move out. 

During this time I met my boyfriend and he made me happy. The moments I have spent with him are the only true happiness I have felt in years. Then this covid thing hit. Lockdown happened and it was awful. I thought I would lose him. However we got through it and came out stronger. Things were going great for a while.

Then my boyfriend got depressed. He has had depression all the time I have known him but it got worse. He went on new medication last month, I don’t know if it was that but he hasn’t been the same since. He has been distant, closed off, and is withdrawing from everyone. All I want is to see him happy. People keep telling me to walk away but I can’t do that. However my head is spinning I feel like he doesn’t want me or doesn’t love me. I don’t know if it is the depression but it hurts seeing him so closed off. I was planning a special day today, to distract him.

Then I woke up and we are back in lockdown. So now I won’t see him for ages. I feel like I’m going to lose him. All I wanted was a simple happy life. A place for us to share, to come home to him at the end of the day. Make him dinner and watch tv together. Go for walks and play video games and get to wake up to him each morning.

I just feel defeated like nothing goes my way. It’s like my life is some sick joke to someone and Im fed up of living it.",mentalhealth,2021-01-23 16:55:09

I work in an ER and recently had a panic attack due to an chance issue of seeing my ex there with her kid who for 3 months of the pregnancy I thought was mine. I didn't talk with her, I didn't see the kid, I was standing by the nurses station waiting for an ambulance to come in and thought I heard a familiar voice. My ambulance got there and I backed up to let them pass and the doctor happens to go into the room and I see her. I had an immediate gut reaction and ran out to the ambulance bay. I had a panic attack all night. I was lucky that this happened 10 minutes before my shift was up and I had a trainee that could help with the ambulance. I had the next day off and I didn't even want to get out of bed. I thought about quitting, even filled out a new application for a different job in a different town. 

Now I am not unfamiliar with mental illness, I have been diagnosed with bipolar for over 15 years now. I have had many many goes with it. What is getting me is that I haven't seen this woman or talked to her for 5 or 6 years. I got out of a super abusive relationship 2 years ago that I don't have any issues with at all anymore and have managed to deal with the aftermath of it fairly well. I just saw this woman's face and I felt like my world was crumbling down. Our relationship, on my end, was never horrible. I loved her with my entire heart, we were engaged, I wanted to become a better person for our lives together and everything. Like this relationship pushed me into the direction that brought me to where I am today, and what I want to do in the future. We had our fights and I feel like our biggest problem was that we suffered a miscarriage and neither of us knew how to handle it... I felt like I had no say in anything or could even feel close to as bad as she did because she went through it. I felt like I was a bystander and could only watch helplessly... So for a year it was a constant thing in our relationship. Then she got pregnant again, we seperated, come to find out the timeframe for the pregnancy fell around a time she cheated on me and she wanted to tell me. So we met up, she told me, I felt a rock in my gut but I gave her a hug, wished her the best, told her I loved her, and haven't heard from her since. She blocked me on facebook shortly after that.

Over the next 5 years I think about her, her kid, and the kid she had. I wonder how they are doing and hope they are happy. I am hurt upset trying to figure out why but justifying it in my head. Telling myself that it would fit that the kid isn't mine, but I don't know. I had a string of shitty relationships then I get in a 2 year abusive relationship and for the most part thought I was over this relationship and then this happens. I honest don't know what to do. I keep having flashbacks of finding her on the bathroom floor in a pool of blood. I see her smile and hear her laugh. I think of cooking her dinner and sleeping in bed next to her. I think of the kid and how much I worry about him, and that I wish I could have handle some things differently. It is eating me up inside.

I talked with my therapist about it and she tried to give me rationale for things but it didn't really sit well with me. She doesn't know my ex and couldn't speak for her (and she said that a few times when trying to talk with me) but I don't even know what I want to happen. I know for a fact that I do not want to have that sort of reaction again. If for some reason that situation would happen again I could not just shut down like I did. I don't want just stop functioning especially when I work in an ER!!!

One of the thoughts I had for trying to work through this is to write a letter to her. Not like one to send her maybe but just to be able to get the words out and see if that helps. Talk about what happened to me when I saw her and how our entire relationship made me feel and what I did with the feelings I had from it. But I don't know if that is appropriate.. I also want to know if the kid is mine or not... like for sure. Even if I haven't been in their life for 5 years I would still like to know... and to offer help however I can and maybe be allowed back into the kid's life.

I started deleting my social media accounts, got rid of 50+ phone numbers of people I don't talk to anymore and went to dig out old photos and hdds to delete every photo I can find.

I hate everything about my life. I don't want people to have videos, photos or voicemessages, or even something handwritten from me.

I betrayed everyone, myself the most. This feels so good now. Just purge yourself from existence. I'll make sure that my body will be very hard to find, there will be no closure for anyone. Knowing this is very exiting to me, but also calms me. Just need to sell all my shit and I'm set. Tell all people you're going to move, make some things up, destroy your life, destroy yourself to fucking finally find peace and escape this worthless existence.

Life is sacred, we as humans are sacred. I truly want everyone that reads this to say right now ""I am sacred"", **out loud.** Feel the emotions that follow it, no emotions follow? **Say it yourself daily and check back in with me in a week, month etc.** 

We are all divine. The characteristics, passions, beliefs, actions that you bring is different from what I bring, your friend brings something different than you and myself and I think thats so beautiful.

If we all realize that we are **ALL** different, then we can begin to have more gratitude, empathy, compassion and love for one another, as well as for ourself. For our path &amp; journey, as well as for others. To celebrate other peoples accomplishments of success, growth and breaking through, rather than quickly going to envy, jealousy, toxicity and projection.

It takes time but when we go inside and constantly are doing the work for ourselves, thats when the healing and understanding will truly come. Go inside, do your work daily, sit in your emotions, feelings and the tough moments, but remember that its all beautiful, its all for something greater than just now, but by living in the present, that is when healing, abundance, peace and happiness can come towards you. **Together, Separately.**

I don't have this with anything or anyone else, I just don't want her to hate me for ignoring her. She's a great parent it's just her voice which has suddenly become really frustrating. Is this just a phase everyone goes through? I feel legitimately insane, it's irrational but I hate it so much.

During this period, I disappointed my family by pursuing a profession that I was much more passionate about (connected with marketing) but which — I never considered at the time — was far less lucrative. 

I know that I am good at what I do (as a consultant, most of my clients are repeat customers who come to me by referral), but, faced with a very high cost of living, I only make enough money to survive month to month and, as a consequence, have a lot of financial stress. 

Before deciding to consult, I worked at a really horrible startup that tried to give me a major promotion but then claimed they were too poor to pay a raise. Two years later, they're still in business. 

A few ""friends"" who work in sales recently divulged how much they're earning. To my surprise, it's more than six figures. And they don't even think that that's a lot. They have absolutely no idea what kind of experiences I have been through here trying to sell different services to their companies — who seem absolutely miserly. And they're treated great to boot.

Evidently what I do (sorry to be vague) is thought of as a low level and poorly remunerated profession here. It's so disheartening to see friends with far less experience making more than 3 times my salary doing something that I think sometimes has little intrinsic value.

I know I shouldn't take it personally, but, as a guy, working in a low paying field makes me feel like a total failure. I like my friends working in sales but feel like cutting them off only because I'm embarrassed about how little I earn. They live such different lifestyles to me and can't even imagine how difficult doing what I do for a career it.  I know that I deserve to be better paid and my friends like to tell me that they'd hire me in a heartbeat because I'm ""so talented"". But nobody with a cheque book is prepared to pay me more than a nominal amount or treat me any better than a task rabbit. It sucks and makes me angry and frustrated.",mentalhealth,2021-01-23 18:01:31

I don't often talk about self harm to anyone outside my treatment team, but I brought it up with my girlfriend because the problem is out of control and I haven't been able to find a reason to stop. I was hoping she would tell me she wanted me to stop so it could be motivation for me, but instead she told me that she wants me to find a more permanent motivation to stop rather than her words. I expressed that I can't FIND a more permanent motivation (I've been doing this for 6 years) and she still wouldn't tell me that I should stop- she told me it's my choice. 

She didn't mean to sound uncaring, she DEFINITELY cares about me, I know this deeply. She wanted me to understand that I should find a deeper reason to stop hurting myself beyond her, because her telling me not to cut would work only temporarily. But... I wanted a temporary, superficial reason. I wanted to not cut today because she told me not to. There's no other way. 

I'm not mad about this because I know she's doing her best. I feel sad because I made it clear what I wanted to hear, she just didn't think it'd be good for me. I understand and respect that, I just want to feel better in the moment... And in the end, I just wanted motivation to stop cutting myself, even if it's temporary.

I’m 25 years of age, married with 3 beautiful children. I am currently diagnosed with severe depression &amp; anxiety since I was about 14/15. I had a traumatising childhood growing up, and was probably the only child (4 other siblings) who was severely beaten by my father growing up. I also had to witness my mother go through the same thing since as early as I can remember. I have overcome many different drug addictions because of all this, however I continuously relapse back to them.I come from the Irish traveler community where trying to speak to someone about mental health is shunned and to put it in a nutshell, your viewed as a fool, and a attention seeker, and will be judged like that the moment you try to speak to someone about it. I was married at a very young age (17) and threw into the lions den and was effectively abandoned by my family to my wife’s people who are known in my community as the worst of the worst when it comes to talking shit about someone, taking advantage of someone, and kicking someone when they are down. Very soon, after my marriage, I went bankrupt and then into debt. Not long after, we had out first child. There was nights I went hungry so they could eat, scrapping up the scraps left in the fridge and freezer. I had to steal food from shops to feed them, and often could not even afford to pay a lowsey tenner for electric and would have to beg it of a enemy. Fast forward a bit anyways, after years of being suicidal, I found a loop hole and it’s safe to say them days are well gone. What I mean is, materialistically, I have nothing to worry about any more, but it just doesn’t change anything. The mental problems are still embedded in my soul. I have everything a man could ask for. A wife (even though she has fuck all respect for me,typical I know) and 3 beautiful children. I am mentally that far gone it’s past suicide, I know that’s not a option as I can’t have it on my soul that my children grow up with the same mental problems I did because there father chose to end he’s life. If I was to tell you simply how I feel it is this; that I am living my life on “auto-pilot”. I’m just doing what I need to do as a father and husband, but just feel numb inside, broken, cold, desperate for a divine intervention. Even posting this I don’t know what I’m asking for, I have no true friends, only associates or people who kiss my arse for a while to get money in there wallet. If you have made it this far I thank you and apologise for rambling on. As I said I don’t really know what I’m asking for on this post, just maybe a response.

My boyfriend at the time nearly didn’t react to it all when I told him about it, which might have been part of the reason. When I entered university I got more aware of what happened. I think I kind of got over it and I‘m doing fine for the most part now. But there are still times where I just get really down and start crying. I do cry alot in general and tiny things are able to make me really sad without me knowing why. I noticed that I do fine as long as I have something to do, although I get incredibly stressed out by having stuff to do. But when there‘s more than a day or two where I can just do whatever I want, I feel like I‘m wasting my life and I start feeling kinda numb. I never actually self-harmed or anything but when I go into a crying fit and just feel pathetic I tend to hit myself in the face. It‘s more to get a clear head again. But all those things are really just sometimes and for most days I‘m happy. So I‘m just not sure if I‘m just having regular bad days or something and don’t really need therapy. A couple of my friends go into therapy and I feel like they have suffered through way worse things than I have, which is also why I don‘t wanna bother them with my stuff. I think I might just be a bit whiny and searching for some attention and that I don’t actually have any problem that requires something like therapy. So I wanted to ask for you guy‘s opinion on it, as I‘m not getting anywhere discussing it with myself.:) I hope this post doesn‘t come across as too attention seeking, I really just want to hear someone‘s thoughts on it. Thank you already in advance.",mentalhealth,2021-01-23 18:40:13

I've never been very social, and I spent a whole lot of time as a kid imagining myself doing something good and people, like my classmates, for example, would ""see"" it and become more accepting of me. I had this habit of going on long walks/runs at night and I would imagine all of that for hours.

I also imagined them ""seeing"" me put through horrible situations, sometimes real, sometimes real but exaggerated, and sometimes completely made up, and feeling like I am so strong to still be who I am with that type of trauma. Then I shifted to imagining different characters in these same awful scenarios. I would then imagine their peers, or parents, or teachers finding out about the awful aspects of their lives, and then becoming more accepting and sympathetic. I would feel really good about that for some reason.

I think I grew out of this. However, to this day I still have this lingering feeling like someone is always watching me, particularly the people I want to think better of me. Sometimes I feel the need to impress them or show them why I am the way I am. I sometimes talk out loud to myself while imagining these people listening in.

I don't have any bad trauma, which makes me feel especially guilty for imagining people giving me sympathy/respect based on the imagined scenarios. This guilt I think is part of the reason I don't do it anymore.

I don't feel any closeness to anybody, including my family and this has been the case my whole life. I don't have any aspirations to strive for and as I don't enjoy anything in my life either, I don't see any reason to live. I \*could\* try to help myself, but I don't see the point. There were many nights when I couldn't stop crying for who knows how long and others when I was just blank. Some of these nights I wished I had somebody I would feel good to be around and wouldn't be ashamed to cry in front of them, however I haven't met such a person and I believe such a person doesn't exist. I have realized the only reason I want to have somebody is to vent, or maybe, I don't know, to not be alone?

It's true I don't understand how human relationships work, but from my impression everyone I knew simply didn't want to be alone. That's just how I see it. Why do you actually want to be \*close\* with someone and how do you actually \*know\* you are?",mentalhealth,2021-01-23 18:45:26

I feel empty and hopeless and I hate myself for who I am and what I've done. The reason it's occuring to me that I'm likely depressed is that this morning I felt a second of actual happiness (like proper happiness, as in how I used to feel) and realised just how unhappy I really am, I realised that feeling how I am is not a great quality of life. 

In school it's a lot worse, people talk about me behind my back all the time because of my bad BO, I always use soap, body wash, hand sanitizer, prescription deodorants and antiperspirants (including roll-ons) you name it, but there's NO way to get rid of it, because of it nobody finds me attractive anymore and I don't trust anyone outside my friend group, I can tell my friend group are good people, but anyone else who tries to talk to me or be friends with me I'm really paranoid and assume they want to make fun of me or manipulate me etc. Because of this I feel naked and exposed walking from class to class, my ""anxiety"" makes me sweat more which worsens my BO, the worst thing about that is if it was anything else they made fun of I wouldn't care, if you call me ugly it won't matter because loads of other people have called me cute, if you insult my personality or how awkward I am then I don't care because I'm aware of that, there's not much to criticize me for (from someone elses perspective) because I'm just kind of dull and in the background of everything, I don't speak much, I'm too scared to even talk to my friends, other people have commented on the fact that at lunch I look really uncomfortable and don't say a single word to anyone for the whole hour (my friends are all extroverts), I'm also really weary of anything I say or do because I feel like I'm being judged and one little thing could completely change someone's interpretation of me. Also I don't want a relationship anyway, I have high and low sex drive sometimes but I don't plan to ever have sex, I don't want a relationship because I honestly don't care if someone is a friend or gf, It'd make me extremely anxious and I'm inexperienced and I feel like and disappoint them plus I'm bad at speaking to people and I have myself and have bad mental health.

I don't self harm often because I'm scared of the shock, I don't have the mental strength to cut myself even though I want to because I deserve it. 

I think about suicide more than anything else, but there's various reasons that I won't do it (family will be sad, scared of dying but not death, hopefully I'll change and forget my past, there's still slight possiblity of me getting happier). 

I'm pretty sure I had borderline OCD at one point but I won't get into that, I was also worried about my health all the time, thinking I had kidney failure, diabetes, polio, Parkinson's, arthritis and tons more stupid stuff, I got a blood test and it revealed nothing serious, but now I'm worried about my liver due to my regular alcohol intake at this age and I'm worried I have arthritis still.

I've lost interest in video games, reading, talking to people and not long ago I also lost interest in sex, going outside, all of my hobbies, music, eating and I didn't get dressed or go outside for weeks, I know everyone feels apathetic in quarantine but for me it doesn't end. I've lost my innocence and happiness and I have done stuff that I can't take back, there's probably no way I can stop hating myself but if I can't be happy I'd like to be at least motivated to live a healthy lifestyle. 

I have bad self confidence too, I don't like myself because I'm a scumbag, hypocrite, lazy, morbid, lustful, procrastinator, pathetic etc.

Another main thing that keeps me going is The Catcher in The Rye, it's my favourite book and really shows how everyone goes through this, ironically I didn't just read that book, it read me.
I sometimes feel like everyone else is oblivious to how depressing, empty and meaningless everything is, and it seems like I'm more aware of this, but I assume that's just my idiocy.

People at school always ask if I'm ok and tell me I seem really sad, there was this girl who was insanely attractive who told me I could talk to her about anything and always asked if I'm ok, she told me I'm cute and that it's shocking that I've never had a gf and said I have really nice eyes and touched my arm flirtatiously and kept smiling and staring at me but me being awkward and anxious and dumb and unhappy I couldn't muster the courage to start conversations with her and something happened which made me question if she's actually my friend or just makes fun of me like everyone else and now we don't talk anymore but yeah. The best things I have in life are sleep and alcohol, they're my escape, nothing else makes me truly happy, but at one point today I did feel confident and in a high mood. Whenever I'm on my way to school I feel confident like I can talk to people and hold my head up and focus on learning, but the closer I get to school the more empty I feel, and by the time I'm there I want to die. I doubt anyone will read all this, but yeah.

Also I hope I didn't offend anyone with this post, a lot of stuff I criticise myself harshly for, I don't at all resent other people for the same things, guess that's one of many examples of my hypocrisy.",mentalhealth,2021-01-23 19:37:40

For all 4 years I've been in high school, I've been in theatre classes. Acting seemed so fun to me, and I enjoyed it. I wanted to be in plays and musicals, but I knew that I wouldn't be able to handle the stress. I actually had to drop out of an ensemble for a show last year because it was too much.

In class, we always have a play that's for the One Act competition. We basically go to a college and compete against other high schools. This play is restricted to just the people in the Advanced Drama class (which is what I'm in.) 

However, since it's Advanced Drama, everyone is required to audition, whether you want a role or not. Of course, you can tell the director that you don't want a role and he won't give you one; you just get a grade to audition. 

Well, that's what happened this year. I went into it not really wanting a role, but not sure. As I read the monologue for the audition, I started feeling more and more passionate about acting. So, I auditioned, and assumed I didn't get anything. But I did. 

The week of the show's rehearsal schedule went like this; Tuesday afterschool from 3:30 to 8. Wednesday until 6:30. Thursday until 8. Friday until 6. Call time was 10 on Saturday (today, actually), and we performed at 1 and 4. 

It was really hard to get through those rehearsals. It was a hard week. And I was really anxious about the show. I haven't performed in front of a crowd before. With anxiety and depression, I didn't know how I was going to react. I worried that I'd blank. I worried that my voice would shake.

Before the first performance, I spent 20 minutes just doing breathing exercises. And then... the performances. 

I did well. I wasn't anxious at all. As soon as I got on stage, I was focused, and I was calm. Even when I performed for just the classroom I would shake. But today, both shows... my voice didn't even shake a bit. 

It was on my ""bucket list"" to be in a production before I graduated, and I didn't think I'd be able to. Even when I was rehearsing for this play, I wasn't sure if I could handle it. But I'm really glad I did. I'm so happy that I've made this much progress. I was faced with a real challenge and I was able to work through it. I was able to enjoy it.

I'm just really happy that I was able to do something so difficult. I'm really proud of myself.",mentalhealth,2021-01-23 19:43:04

So for starters, I’ve had anxiety and depression for pretty much as long as I can remember, but I only went to get help when I was 17. I received some therapy and meds for both, but things still weren’t quite right for me.
I began looking into what could be going on, and ended up going for ADHD testing when I was 18. I was diagnosed with that too, and given a stimulant, which works for the most part, though it’s not perfect.
Life at home was, and still is, fine. I live in a middle class family, and my parents are really good, so I’m pretty sure the majority of this isn’t caused by them. There was never any abuse, physical or mental, they’re great parents, which is why some of this confuses me even more.
The thing is, I have some symptoms that don’t line up with regular ADHD symptoms, and I’m hoping some people here have experienced some of these and know what’s going on.

First of all, I’m really sensitive to everything. Sounds, textures, smells, the whole lot. There are several things that set off what I can only describe as a wave of panic and/or anger. Not just a little bit either. My heart rate jumps, and I feel like I need to leave the room, even though there’s no real reason for it. Overly loud noises like yelling or sudden bangs also set me off, often making me cry, and I have no clue why. The yelling is especially bad, even if it’s not angry yelling, or directed at me.
Second, I actually enjoy repetition. Monotonous tasks that require concentration aren’t difficult if I enjoy them, like building things over and over again, and drawing. I love throwing my full attention in researching topics I’m interested in, but as soon as I have no interest, staying focused becomes impossible. Everything I’ve read about ADHD says that concentration is jumpy no matter what, and I usually don’t exhibit those qualities.
Third, I am an extremely emotional person, and feel an overwhelming amount of empathy in every situation, until I actively have to interact with the person I’m feeling for. Everything sort of goes blank. No emotion or anything, and not even an empty feeling, I just feel normal in a situation where I shouldn’t be. (This goes for both sad and happy occasions)
Fourth, this is the last one, don’t worry, is eye contact. I hate it. I don’t know how to describe the feeling, but any form of eye contact is extremely uncomfortable. Generally, I can talk with someone so long as we’re both looking away, but if they stare at me, or try to make eye contact, I just can’t do it.

Do you experience any of these symptoms? Do they come from ADHD, or possibly something else? Are my anxiety and depression contributing factors to some of these symptoms? I’d really like to know, as this impacts my life dramatically and my meds just don’t cover everything. Even if you have some tips or tricks that could help, I’d really appreciate hearing from you.",mentalhealth,2021-01-23 20:37:46

I've got a lot of horrible secrets that I've never told anyone before and I want to get off my chest. You don't have to reply or even read it all. I'd just like to know that, somewhere in the world, someone knows.

TRIGGER WARNING

- My family is filled with rapists and child molesters, my uncles, my grandads, my brother. Every male in my family is one. I grew up knowing my mother was heavily abused and, on several occasions, was forced to do horrible things with her siblings (my aunts), so they can no longer bare to even look at each other anymore, so I can't speak to my aunts.

- The night my sister told my mother that my brother sexually assulted her as a child on several occasions, my mother threw up, cried, hit walls, ran outside and sobbed. I think about it every day. I often bled (down there) as a child, and woke up with no pants often, so I think my brother used to do the same to me in my sleep. I never told my mum or the police, which could have helped my sister's case. I regret that every day.

- My father, an abusive, horrible man, who looks genuinely kind and sweet so it confused me as a child whenever he was mean, was arrested for murder in 2019. The police thought he pushed a girl he was using for sex out of a 5th story building. The woman is paralyzed. He was released, but I know he did it.

- My Grandad recently got cancer for the second time, and about a month ago, my mother was sent to the hospital. The doctor's say her body is trying to produce cancer. This could be caused by stress, of course because of everything she's been through. She cries all the time, thinking I don't hear, but I do.

None of my friends know any of this, and believe my life is perfect :)))

This is probably the 3rd time I have tried asking for help and advice and it went the same way. I don't want tough love from people who have absolutely no idea who I am or to what level I can deal with.

So, I'm done asking for help.

I'm done thinking that there might be someone in this internet space that will have any compassion with me. I always see other people receiving support from complete strangers and I get ""suck it up"" and telling me to talk to a therapist about being ""too sensitive.""

I'm beginning to believe by the treatments and reactions that I always get from people that I deserve the depression and body dysmorphia I've been struggling with. Treating me rudely really makes me feel like a pos.

Sorry for this self-pitying bs. I'm just tired. I've been struggling for so long and having very, very little support and care is really getting to me.

I don’t. Let me just say that right now. I see the problem. I don’t do this, but it takes everything in me to control the urge. I’m in therapy, dealing with trauma, dealing with a lot of mental health issues. I grew up in a family where I was emotionally abused, suppressed, and ignored - so now any time someone seems to care, I want to immediately open up to them, even if I haven’t spoken to them in years.

Psychologically, I want the validation the comes from them caring. Again, I don’t do this. I’m not a mean person. I would do anything for anyone, and I’m a good listener. And I would never hurt or burden someone by just dumping my problems on them. But at the same time, man, it’s tough for me. Cause I crave feeling like I matter. I crave knowing that  people with every bone in my body and I’m compulsively compelled to do this.

But I don’t do this. Because I’m not manipulative. I’ll suffer. I’ll deal with the pain. I’ll deal with feeling like my head will implode. I deal with feeling like I have bricks on my chest, and that my world is spinning and collapsing around me. Because if I give into this feeling, and dump into everyone who gives me two minutes of their time, it would make me a very very toxic person.

He was most likely killed by natural causes and while I never met him, my father would always tell us how great he was. It's depressing to hear that he died completely alone. My father has been cooped up in his office sobbing ever since. My father has helped me through so much shit and it burns to see him so broken. So I told my friends on a school discord server we have about the news and they were supportive for the most part except this one dude. I'm not going to say any names so let's call him Richard because he's a massive dick. So Richard and I don't really like each other the most, so I think this might've affected what he said, but it doesn't excuse what he did. What he said was the most insensitive thing I've ever read. He said, this is a direct quote by the way I didn't make this up for attention, ""bro get off the internet cuz no one cares"". He then immediately realized that he fucked up tremendously and instead of apologizing he doubles down and says, ""JOEKS! BRO, I'M JOKING! LMFAO"". As if an excuse like that is gonna do anything. You don't joke about that shit. We were all rightfully pissed and I'm pretty sure the mods took it to the DMs.

My parents have always sheltered me, being an only child and I’ve always been a bit shy. I have always been “the odd friend out” in every single group I’ve been in.

My grades have slowly slipped, but I put in just enough effort to cruise through with a decent mark, but it’s just not enough anymore. I’m slacking and I use videos and social media to distract myself. 

Quarantine has left me alone with my thoughts. I’ve been cheating to maintain good marks in university. Stuck at home with my parents nagging me about my grades. Dreading returning to normal because my laziness might be put out in the open. I’m scared my carefully managed facade  of “oh she’s so smart” will crumble and everyone will see me for the fraud that I am. A useless, lazy, 18 year old, with no job, no true friends with a cliche and unachievable goal of becoming a doctor.

Well anyways, it feels a bit better to put it out there. I think this is the worst I’ve felt in a long time. Wish my parents didn’t think I was kidding when I said I wanted to see a therapist, what good is free Canadian health care when you can’t even take advantage of it?

I got laid off by my lazy ass bossman doing landscaping and carpentry construction labor work.

The healthiest routine I'd EVER had in my life went the way of the t-rexs and ever since, on top of mass quantities of methamphetamines and/or not like it mattered dextroamphetamines... I've not been the same person, man, entity, whatever.

3 stays in the same psychiatric hospital in barely 2 months later I'm diagnosed either paranoid schizophrenic, schizoaffective, and/or manic depressive psychosis.  I n4ver got the same diagnosis but apparently 'schiz''ll be a really fun label I'll have to wear the rest of my life after 2 involuntary commissions and then a voluntary.

Sorry to ramble incoherently for no apparent reason but im scared as hell i can't even work anymore. I never leave my grandmothers house... The law is after me BAD constantly and relentlessly. 

They fly drones invisible ones and visible ones and all kinds of constant surveillance on me 24/7. The scary part i mentioned is this: according to every single person in my life under the gray clouds doesn't agree or see or hear what i do.

Seroquel made me a split personality not me, Zyprexa is, aside from pharmaceutical dextroamphetamines the best pill I've ever took in my life.

It makes me feel like the person i was before all of last years trauma really did a number on me. 

My doctor said i needed to apply for disability and community support services (ACT team in NC I guess?) as soon as I could. Well what about getting back to work? 

She advised me that wouldn't be a realistic thing to do with the 'shape' I'm in. Well that doesn't help pay for my grandmas dementia meds or help keep the lights on... I mean we look like freakin Holocaust survivors we've both lost so much weight in the last year.

Anyone have any advice or pointers on what i should do? I just got out of the hospital AGAIN last night for scaring workers at the Dollar Tree who then call the law on me for no reason... And I went berzerk. 

I cannot handle interaction with law enforcement without thinking they're going to tase me twice again for trying to slit my own throat thinking they were about to shoot me anyway. 

I was diagnosed PTSD on top of all the schiz from that situation... when I try to explain my pending disability application in a job interview... the looks i get are really probably enough to put 'suicidal ideation' in God himself.

Anyways ... the past two weeks everything seems like a blur. Like life isn’t real. I remember days as if they were dreams and each second I forget more and more and everything seems less clear. When I was I often forget where I’m going, I’m on autopilot and people around me seem like still figures until they interact with me. When I talk to people I feel like I’m watching myself talk from a different perspective. I don’t control what I say... it’s like I say whatever comes out and it’s usually just any normal response. 

I hate fucking everyone literally everyone is annoying and I pretend to like them just to avoid conflict of any sort. I feel like when I talk to people I’m faking every single word that comes out and I’m a new person just to feel that fake happiness or fondness of a friend or something like that. 

Even as I type this I feel like I’m asleep and spilling out words... I’m confused and I can’t even cry anymore. I’m distraught and scared. I feel my heart break as I distance myself from my mind and heart and those I love. 

There are people I love and I feel like they’re slipping away because my autopilot talks for me. I can’t even have a conversation because I’m not me... I’m this character. Everything is fake. My teachers praise me and I don’t react I don’t feel like I did anything good at all. I just put in the effort I see fit and that’s that. I’m so tired of this. Idk what to do...

I honestly believe I will never love anyone as much as I loved them. Whenever I tell anyone that they tell me I'm being naive and that I will think differently in the future. Maybe I am being naive but why does everyone always feel the need to point it out. It makes me feel horrible and even more depressed than I already am. My feelings have not fluctuated at all since the end of it and I have no idea what to do. People around me have forced me into ""taking the next steps"" without accounting for what I want because they ""know its for the best"". I'm grateful for their support but their complete lack of judgement about how I feel makes me angry. 

I tried looking up things around heartbreak to see if there was advise on how to just be content with it rather than the cut throat advice everything seems to offer. There was nothing but countless sites telling me to things of grandeur in order to get over it. Why? I understand for some break ups are hard and very upsetting to the point where actions such as those may be necessary but why is that always seen as the norm when it's not. Changing your number is really not a requirement of dealing with a standard break up yet I had multiple people tell me to do so ""cut all contact, block or change everything"". It's so stupid to be going that far when it's not necessary 

Why can't we just accept that some people are fine moving at their own pace through things? And why do we always see it as a problem that needs to be fixed?

Am I consistently more depressed because of it? Yes. Is that effecting my work? Yes. Will I allow it to continue affecting me? Yes, because I'm not done with the situation and I'm fine with that.

I guess I'm just really sad because I know they'll never come back to me but I don't want to live without them. There isn't a day where I do not think about them and since I met them I've never stopped loving them.

I want to be happy but I just want to be loved by the person who once loved me more. I'm mad about people not accepting that, let me move at my own pace.",mentalhealth,2021-01-23 22:53:40

For example, one of her roommates blamed her for something small like leaving a door unlocked, and she called on the phone me in tears. She was very distressed and shaking from it. She felt like her roommates are disappointed in her and don’t like her anymore and are chatting behind her back... all over a silly mistake. Oh, and they eventually concluded that she wasn’t the one to leave the door unlocked. 

So this is an example of a situation that she has a very hard time dealing with. For somebody like me, I would just take control over the conversation and say “nah I didn’t do that. Don’t blame me”. I understand that she wouldn’t be able to do something like that, well not currently at least. 

So how do I help her when she calls me crying? 

I’ve tried telling her “you’re just thinking about it too much”, “I’m sure they’re not mad at you”, “it’s not that deep”. 

It just makes me sad that she (and others) have such a hard time dealing with common, everyday mishaps. I’m hoping some of you might be able to relate to her and help me when these situations arise.

I fantasize about myself getting raped and being kidnapped and beaten while a group of people fuck me and I basically just want to be degraded and taken control of so bad without any say in it. It's to the point where I'm kind of scared for myself because I've been considering putting myself into dangerous situations just to live this fantasy. One of my biggest fantasies is being kidnapped and made into some sort of sex slave where I get fucked constantly without consent. It makes me really confused because I know that these things actually happen to real people and it completely fucks up their life so I don't understand why I want it to happen to me but I can't control the urge and I feel really shitty about it.

I want to preface all of this by saying I am in, for me at least, a great place right now. I’ve struggled greatly in my life (25 Years Old started to tackle Mental Health issues in my early teens) with anxiety, depression, and just overall mental health. I went through one pretty traumatic experience a few years ago related to my struggles that I don’t want to go much into today because it could be it’s own post entirely. The issue today is that over the past few months I’ve finally learned for the most part to live with my past struggles and move forward to the best of my abilities. For the most part lately I’ve been confident, outgoing, and assertive. I’ve tried to step into more of a leadership role at work, the same way I used to in the past at previous jobs or even in athletics. I’m getting back to my true self...and not the anxious, quiet/awkward, passive one I spent so long as.

But I just still can’t shake the little things. It’s maddening. Every single day something small or trivial is said or done by someone else and I feel that snap behind my eyes. Depending on what the trigger is I get that  surge of anger and frustration, that wave of insecurity and jealousy, or that gnawing feeling of doubt. I restrain myself and compose myself instantaneously from acting on these feelings like I might at my lower points and move forward. My eyes and momentary distance from the present moment may give away that I’ve briefly nearly lost my cool but I move forward. I put back on my happy energetic face and try to block out the negative. The issue being these small moments, these little trivial issues can throw me off for hours. After a bit of me calming down I then fall into the next part of this process...self loathing. I feel the wave of sadness and shame for getting easily triggered and am lost for a while. Once again staying mostly composed but probably being exposed by my sad or withdrawn eyes and subtle retreat to my thoughts. The self loathing sets in and it takes a while to fight through it and get back to the present. Let me give an example to elaborate...most of these issues pertain to work for various reasons. Main one being I’ve never struggled being myself around family and friends but have greatly felt that my anxiety and depression impacted the person I presented to new people or casual acquaintances/coworkers. Which has always made it hard to consistently make new friends or lovers from my day to day life.

Example: I’m at work and in good space. Someone does something that irks me and feels a little like a slight of me. Sometimes it’s coupled by them doing or saying something that also causes some small resentment for them —&gt; I get angry/frustrated and or insecure/jealous —&gt; I go on autopilot briefly while my mind battles itself to fight the feelings —&gt; I snap out of it as I’m composed and worry others noticed me get upset over basically nothing —&gt; I get back to baseline and go about my business —&gt; I begin to give in to self loathing and am back on autopilot but noticeably more distant —&gt; I get back to baseline and try to feign that nothing happened

I’ve been feeling good and largely mentally healthy and happy for a few months as I said and if this is all I’m battling at this point then fucking fantastic lol Five million times better than the past for me  but nonetheless it still causes distress

Just want to know if any one has a similar cycle of emotions they go through and any advice on how “Not to Sweat the Small Stuff” I’d love feedback. I’d also love to chat with people about examples in better detail that we’ve both encountered. And if anyone wants advice on how to work through issues with confidence and self-loathing or hatred I’d love to lend an ear and some advice if I can!

Literal minutes before this point, I thought we were in the committed relationship we had always had been in. We had a big fight and he seemed to just shut down and end it. This is a bit of a long story but here we go. Around a month ago, he made a silly mistake. I forgave him for it almost instantaneously. However, he simply could not forgive himself. He was fine at first, but his guilt ended up eating him up inside. He went into a depression. Due to his ADHD, he also lost access to his emotions numerous times. It got to the point where just being with me was too painful to him and made him more depressed each time. 

I knew about all of this, however; I never imagined he would leave. He hadn’t even gotten professional help in months. It seems like he just gave up without trying. He was on a family trip at the time and seemed to not care about what was happening. Every time I tried to text him about how hurt I was, he would say “it breaks my heart when you say these things.” He then simply turned his phone off. He left home so abruptly and I have no idea how he was so callous with it.

I met up with him the night after he got back. He wasn’t the same person to me, he didn’t have a light in his eyes; he looked damaged.after 2 hours of talking we agreed to take a break and not break up. This means we would leave our hearts open to each other, however, I was allowed to move on when I decided I was ready. We also agreed to absolutely zero contact and he said we would be strangers if we were to see each other again which really hurt. 

I honestly don’t think this is the same person I’ve known For 4 years. The worst part is that he told my sister he didn’t think he could ever get better. My mere presence apparently sent him deeper into depression and sometimes numbness. I feel so hopeless. 

Please give me advice/personal stories/better understanding/ anything. 

 Do you think this has anything to do with his ADHD coupled with depression? What should I do? He was there for me through my Hardest time and not once did I think he would leave. Why can’t I be there for him now?

&amp;#x200B;

I was already on therapy I feel nervous/anxious going to therapy again, I feel like I am creating all this things and they are fake.  Also, I am aware why I am behaving like this, especially why I hate myself and all is because I didn't take advantage of growing up emotionally and creating strong relationships in university  and now with pandemic I feel so lonely and desperate about a friendship and more about having a strong relationship with a gf. I feel like I haven't show my true potential because I was afraid of people  or to bother them with my presence, I always wanted to do volunteering work but....  I always wanted to help people but.... 

well maybe I just need to tell this or whatever..... sometimes I can't sleep

There are times when I become so irrational, panicky and my mood swings are all over the place that I feel like it would be really unfair on the other individual to have to go through someone like me. My emotional dysregulation is really high and I have this constant need for attention (which my Trauma Therapist said is actually support seeking), which I do not think any individual has the capacity to provide after getting into adulthood. 

At the same time, I know I do need the support of a partner, because healing becomes a little bit easier when you know you are loved.

I would do anything to be with another person when is struggling with a mental illness though.

I remember wanting to be hurt as young as 7 years old, if not younger. I started self harming when I was 11; cutting, burning, scratching, hitting, starving, overeating.

I purposely deprived myself of sleep. I dream about freezing, or drowning. I want someone to me, abuse me; verbally, physically, sexually. 

I don’t think it’s a sexual thing or an attention thing. I hate being in positions where I don’t have any power, especially physically. I hate it when people know that I’m hurt, I have always gotten irrationally angry, and upset; whether what they knew of was self harm or otherwise. 

I feel calm, and content, when I’m in pain. Sometimes I feel like I have to hurt myself in order to feel okay, like I have to make it even; otherwise I don’t deserve to feel okay.

However, I don’t know what happened that he never stayed because there were rumors that the child wasn’t his. About 15 years later, when I was 11 he went back to his home country to meet this “daughter” without me or my mom. This caused a lot of issues in my family because my dad never involved my mom or I in this. We had no idea he had left to meet her because my mom and I were on a vacation with family. When we got back he was gone. He came back, but the fighting was constant, constant talk about divorce. Anyways, I never cared to have a relationship with her because of how much issues her existence caused, I genuinely didn’t feel the need to, and even though my whole dads side of the family recognizes her as their family and they say she looks just like my dad, we don’t even know 100%. Also, my dad or no one has ever introduced us as “sisters” and we’ve been in the same room a few times. It’s so odd to me that my dads side of the family has a relationship with her but hide it behind mine and my moms back. My dad also secretly messages her and they remain in touch. Maybe he’s not hiding it but he never talks about it. It’s all so secretive and I think it’s disrespectful. Am I not enough of a daughter to him. I’m at a point where I want to distance myself from my dad and all of this. It’s been 15 years of the same thing. I tell him what bothers me and he just argues with me.

While this study aims to enhance research and clinical considerations for LGBQ young adults and their families, it recognizes that stigmas faced by the trans\* community are unique and should not be coupled with stigmas faced by other minority groups. Therefore this study does not include trans\* individuals. This does not mean that trans\* and LGBQ individuals do not share common stigmas, but this study does not wish to generalize unique lived experiences that require more specialized research for this group.

Please feel free to share my survey with your friends, family, and/or someone you think would be interested in participating in this study. Thank you!!!!",mentalhealth,2021-01-24 01:51:07

My issue is I lost my thing I don't have a meaning anymore, I used to love things, I played guitar, I played videogames, I loved exercising, I love math a lot, but now I don't, it all feels like work, everything seems so empty now, I still do it all every day but I don't feel anything while doing it, I feel like its all worth nothing, I still like doing math but it doesn't feel good to do, it used to be my thing but now when I study it somehow in a way hurts, it hurts to think, it hurts to do anything, mentally I cant dedicate emotion to anything anymore, there is no feeling in my heart for anything. I love talking to my friends but only for a short time and the entire time I speak empty words, don't get me wrong I love them but I feel nothing else.

I don't have the thing in my life that gives me meaning, I don't have the thing that fills the void in my heart anymore, I lost it all.

It feels like I'm wearing a scarlet letter that everyone can see and I am desperately trying to hide it. I've had bosses who I think hired me only because of my low self-esteem because I would accept a lower wage. I have a good job now and I am so desperate to appear like I am not constantly struggling with my anxiety and self-consciousness but it's bleeding out since everything is remote. (I can't just see my teammates faces to determine how they feel about my projects so I'm constantly overworking because I'm so worried that I'm not doing enough.) I'm so exhausted, I'm completely burning out and the only person who has caused it is me. To do less work takes as much mental energy as working too much. And I just hate myself for being this way. 

I am always trying to prove that I'm better at things, but I'm actually not. I particated in tons of competitions in school desperate to win so I could say I'm good enough, but I'm not actually very good and mostly relied on my team. It hurts because I don't realize I'm doing these things in the moment, but I look back at videos and pictures of how uptight I was, how desperate I am for the validation that I'm not shit - because I can't see that being a little good is an OK thing to be.
And it feels like I'm crazy because I can't see that I'm doing this? What if I do other things and lose control?

For a few years I would occasionally steal things from the school store. I'm not a klepto, I didn't get satisfaction from it, in fact I felt guilty about it, but I still did it repeatedly. I just felt that I deserved to have x-small thing just as much as anyone else at school. I felt so angry that the school price hiked and item that I felt I /NEEDED/ to succeed. That I would buy it at the price I thought was fair. (If a pack of note cards you can buy at the dollar store off campus was $3 at school, and there is no way for me to leave campus to get to the dollar store because all the parking permits are sold to upperclassmen, I'd pay for one pack and have a second in my pocket. That felt /fair/.)

I LEGITIMATELY didn't feel I was doing anything wrong for years and even mentioned I did it to a friend. That scares me.

In the same realm, I'm scared that one day I'm going to be abusive. Because people were abusive to me and I'm still angry. And yes I'm in therapy and it does absolutely jack shit. I've been in it for years and they have zero plan about my abuse and we make fucking small talk for an hour and she tells me to do fucking Instagram shit like yoga like fucking stretches are going to have ANYTHING TO DO with the MASSIVE BALL OF ANGER that floats over me every fucking day that I'm in therapy because I want to talk about.

My friend voiced her disagreement about it, stating that she wasn’t comfortable being used as a punishment and stated a desire to talk about it more. 

I told her I respected her viewpoint, and that value her feedback on parenting, but that I wasn’t interested in the conversation because the decision to hand out consequences—not punishment—is mine to make, especially as I confided feeling like I’m at my breaking point. These aren’t easy words for me. I have a history of suicide attempts, and she knows this. Even after I revealed struggling, she just kept pushing, and said we needed to talk, again ignoring my boundary where I said I wasn’t willing to do it. 

She didn’t even acknowledge that I’m devastated about the behavioral challenges we’re trying to address. It went back and forth until she told me she didn’t feel the friendship could continue without the conversation. So I split the difference—I told her I would do what she wished, but that my feelings, which had previously been hurt about the total disregard for my articulated boundaries, were now of the pissed off variety.

The thing is, I’m mentally not in a very good headspace right now, and haven’t been for some time. I’ve been fighting with my child for days. I’ve spent the last week having a full-on breakdown about my lacking as a parent. I worry that I’m reenacting my own abuse experiences, so someone steamrolling over a set boundary is also incredibly triggering. None of that is relevant to the conflict, but I don’t know that I am going to be capable of letting this go. 

She crossed several lines. We’ve never had a fight before, but this is one I’ve crowdsourced to half a dozen people without identifying details. Every single person, whether or not they had kids, thought she was wildly out of line for trying to control the limits we set with our own daughter. And while I agree with them, the bigger issue is how I said, more than once, “I am not willing to discuss this.” I have never told her that before, and I’m guessing I will have to say it again.

I don’t normally have conflicts with people, so to have one that is so personal hurts. I know I need to let this go, but I don’t know how. Please, I would welcome any feedback.",mentalhealth,2021-01-24 03:02:34

One of my friends brought me into the group during a time I was feeling downs and I just now finally started to feel like I was a part of it. Funnily enough I was kicked out while I was telling everyone that I’d be there for them no matter what.

I was kicked out by said original friend and I just don’t know. I keep losing friend after friend after friend. I have one friend group left but they’re not nice to me. I barely get any sort of respect in it and remarks they make really hurt me sometimes. I can’t do confrontation because of learned helplessness acquired by arguments with my father at a young age. I would like to not be lonely so I’m walking on eggshells as best as I can... but I can’t take it anymore in my mind.

I keep losing friends and people I care for, people who I’ve known for a long time. I just want to find people who genuinely care about me, want to spend time with me, and tell me that they like having me around. Is that too much to ask?

(Not self harm/suicide),"This is a bit of a mess as I’m currently in a really bad spot (No this is not about self harm and/or Suicide)

Everything I know, or at least knew about myself has derailed and I’m lost as a person. Recently, thoughts of wanting to live a harder life have began to strike me.

I’ve always known I’ve come from a well off, middle class family where I as a Teenager, have not had to work as much as other people to obtain comfort. Everything I’ve ever needed has come to me from my Parents and it’s taken tolls on me. I hate receiving anything of value or of personal significance, it’s always been a problem but has been getting worse now. Things such as new clothes, gifts (especially) , the new Second Hand Iphon (my first ever phone) or even my new Physics and Mathematics text books for school.

Because I KNOW I have grown up in a loving, well off household in a farely large house on a plot of farm land, I feel guilty for everything I have. I didn’t have to work for this... or. Why do I deserve this, there are people who are suffering way worse than I am have been some of the more prevalent things drifting in my head.

The one I am most confused about though is that I wish that my life was plagued with serious struggles. For some reason, I wish that I was neglected, hurt or abused as a child... as a reason to be like how I am currently feeling. I wish my life was better, that I didn’t have all this luxury, a personal computer, loving parents, a warm meal every night and a bed to sleep in. 

As a random thing, I’ve taken watching more serious Anime (I know I know, fucking weeb)  and boxing as means to vent this but it’s only making it worse, I see these tragic, life long mental debilitations that some characters go through and I wish I was there, to either help cope or replace them outright. For example, Kayo Hinazuki (from “Erased”) a young girl physically and emotionally abused by her mother and grown up in a toxic household, for some fucked up reason, I wish I was in a similar situation, to give me an excuse to recluse and to run away from everything, or to at least be like the Protagonist, someone who actively helps her escape from that life. This thoughts process is incredibly incorrect and I know that. And as a consequence to this, I’ve retracted from all I considered friends, I haven’t spoken or interacted with them for the whole month we’ve been in break (7 Week period, I’m still in Secondary School/College).   
I don’t know how to convey my twisted and blatently wrong thoughts and feelings but I feel like I needed to post it somewhere, I need help guys, no matter what I do or try to ensure myself that this is not what I want, “No one should have to go through this“, I just can’t get it out of my head. What can I do to cope, this is just one page on the novel of things I’m experiencing.

I just wish that I had to experience something, have a reason to be pained. I’ve been like this for a while and I can’t muster the courage to ask to be booked to a therapist, if you guys have any advice or just want to yell at me, I’ll take it. I just want to be around someone. i’m happy to post more information if needed, thank you.",mentalhealth,2021-01-24 03:57:41

I don’t think there has been a person alive who could bull shit you with the confidence and finesse that I possess. Its a defense mechanism you see. If I can convince you all that I am fine and that things are going swimmingly, then I can in time come to believe it myself on some level. Even though there is that nagging place in the corner hidden from view that knows the truth. And that truth slowly seeps out and wishes to be known, because maybe someone will see that I am no longer even treading water, but have in fact taken on too much and am damn near sunk.

That is where we are. For the past three or four years now, I have had worse and worse health. Most of you who are close to me know what that is due to. Its been nearly 10 years now since I had emergency Gall Bladder removal surgery. For nearly seven months prior to the surgery I had a weird feeling in my abdomen where I felt like I was a book and that was my spine if that makes sense. This was coupled with chronic constipation and abdominal pain that would come and go. But I was told I was crazy and it was nothing. Until they finally took me seriously and my gall bladder had become so infected and swollen that it didn’t have gall stones anymore, but was filled with sludge.

So I had that removed and nearly died. The surgery itself seemed to have gone fine but in the recovery they noticed that I had rattling in my lungs and my anesthesiologist said I am pretty certain he has developed Pneumonia and looked at my x-rays and said that was the case. The Doctor over recovery said I didn’t and he was being overly emotional. That didn’t set well with my guy who went to bat for me. Turned out I did in fact have a gnarly case of Pneumonia AND for a bonus, my Hemoglobin was at 6 when it was supposed to be a 12 which indicated internal bleeding some where. They could not tell me where. So I was admitted and spent over a week in the hospital being pumped full of antibiotics and for the first time in my life, blood infusions.

I was sent home with no real support system or what to look for other than “If your incision opens go to ER”. Well that’s a given. So when things hurt, I stopped doing them. Well this led to me slowly getting weaker and weaker. On top of that I developed even more intense depression. I began to cry out of no where, and I am not talking single tears of reminiscing, but full on “My dog just got hit by a car right in front of me, and this dog is the dog that helped deliver me when my mother died during child birth and in essence raised me”. That was new. But so too was the isolation. It was slow at first. But little by little I stopped going out with friends and my husband and instead opted to stay at the house.

Well this continued, the isolation got worse. My depression got worse. My muscles atrophied, and issues related to my Rickets started to get worse. My hearing started going out faster and faster to the point that if you speak to me on my right side, don’t expect an answer. I have since been to a boat load of doctors thanks to my PCP who took my concerns seriously and always got me the referrals to the relevant people. I started seeing an Endocrinologist for my X-linked Hypophosphatemic Rickets (XLH) which is a rare genetic form of Rickets. I then started seeing a rheumatologist for my persistent lower back pain. When I had been in a car accident a few thanksgivings back, they had noticed on my X-Rays that my discs in my back were fusing together. Well turns out that they are! I also have Ankylosing Spondylitis which accounts for the horrible back pain and tailbone pain as well as a few other things I had been dealing with. AS is an autoimmune disease. It causes the body to attack itself which causes inflammation which leads to the pain and other things.

Well the above things have crippled me in many ways. I can no longer walk. I can stand for brief periods to transfer out of bed to my manual wheel chair or my power chair and then to the car if I need to go to an appointment but that is it. Because of my tailbone pain I can’t sit up for long so once my appointments done, I have to get home and to bed. I cant even sit up in bed, and have to have a bed that has the ability to lower and raise the head and feet independently so throughout the day I can alleviate the pressure on my tailbone and get even minor relief.

So my days consist of being bed bound in my room where I never leave. These four walls are my prison. My range of motion is gone. So I cant bend over if I drop anything on the floor. Since my gall bladder removal I developed a condition called Dumping Syndrome. This means I have diarrhea everyday of my life. It will hit with literally zero warning, and at the worst times. So in my mid to late 20’s I had to start wearing Adult Diapers. In the beginning I could change them myself and clean myself up if needed no problems. Now, due to my muscle atrophy and range of motion going to shit, I can not. I now depend on my husband to clean me up when I have Bowel Movements. I also can no longer Shower on my own or fully dress myself without my husband. He works 70 hours a week. So some days if I have a bowel movement I get to sit in it for 8-10 hours until he can come home. This has become problematic.

During all of the things I have listed above I have been coming to terms with the fact I am Trans. That will be a post for another time. But the dysmorphia is severe now and has been an aggravating factor in my mental health deterioration. I look in the mirror at my knotted and matted hair and the beard I am now sporting, due to not having the ability or the energy to shave any more, and I cry. My anxiety shoots through the roof. I hate the person staring back at me. Who I see doesn’t match who I see myself as if that makes sense. All the while I would love to be living my fully authentic self, which my husband fully supports and has been just the best about to be quite honest, but I don’t know where to begin. Where do I get a custom wig made for myself that looks natural. I fear being clocked in public. How do I address the facial hair and arm hair so I again can look how I feel. Makeup, I don’t have the faintest Idea of how to put it on, if I even have the limb dexterity to do that now. I am overwhelmed.

I find myself thinking about my death a great deal lately. Obsessively. I am afraid of dying. But I feel like I will be dead soon as my health and overall state of being has gotten so bad. I can’t roll over in my own bed. I get winded adjusting in the bed. I am a burden to the man who I vowed to be a helpmate to. I need help. I want help but god knows where the hell to get it. I have been researching Inpatient facilities I could go to get some intensive therapy and help but they are all so far away, or expensive as hell. And trying to find one that will help me with the transgender issues I face and won’t try and change me or will be safe for me to be in (patients wise) is overwhelming and scary and so far, fruitless.

I don’t know where to go or what to do. I do know this will be where I put my thoughts about things. Maybe you are in a similar boat and we can talk and support one another, or maybe you just would like to follow me on this journey of life. I welcome you regardless so long as your intentions are pure. Anyone wishing to make cruel jokes or whatever, please don’t waste either of our times. Positivity only.

That’s from my blog so I don’t have to rehash everything. At this point I’m not sure what to do. I know I need inpatient help. Outpatient isn’t well suited for me as i require ridged structure and medicine tweaks as everything I’ve taken since I was 7 for my depression has failed. I’m 31 now. I’m at the end of my rope. I was in kosairs Children’s hospital when I was 14 for 3 months after a suicide attempt. It helped some but at 14 I wasn’t taking it nearly as seriously as I should have. But the structure helped, but once I was back with my family they didn’t help me hold myself accountable and stick with things and they were hella abusive and toxic. I am married now and my husband is the best there is and super supportive of me always so I know once I find a place that will work with my unique set of circumstances and I can get the tools to begin to take back my life he will be Cagney to my Lacey and make sure I stick with it. Any advice or places you could recommend for a trans individual with multiple mental and physical health issues and that works with low income people. I have found a ton of outpatient places that are waaaaaaay too expensive and I just have Blue cross and blue shield and my premiums and everything just reset T.T",mentalhealth,2021-01-24 04:33:14

I'm 26. I've been diagnosed with anxiety and depression, been medicated for each on different occasions. I need constant reassurance, especially in friendships and relationships. I fear that my friends don't really like me, and talk badly about me when I'm not around.

I hate driving SO MUCH because I am terrified I'm going to hit someone or something. I hate crowds because there are too many people and it's too much noise and get lost. I hate talking to new people because I don't know what to say to them, and I always overshare without meaning to. And I can't always tell how they feel when they're talking to me and it drives me crazy.

I think I'm too honest, but I can't help it. I have hurt people's feelings because of it. I am not trying to be hurtful, I am trying to help. I used to be told a lot that I'm a know it all and that I think I'm smarter than everyone else but I really don't. That really hurt so now I try really hard NOT to come across that way and I won't speak up even if I do know the solution to something.

I don't think much of myself, I'm a burden on my mom and my friends. And they would all be better off without me. I regret letting some of them get close to me, because I've only made their lives more difficult. It feels like life is just too much and I can't handle it. I dropped out of school because the pressure was too much and I wanted to die. I don't know how I will ever survive a normal life.

I think there is something wrong with me. I don't think it's normal to have a panic attack at the grocery store because ""there are far too many people near the check out and there's not really a line exactly and you don't know where to go so you go to the electronics section so you can maybe check out there instead but you are scared to ask so you just walk around until someone else goes first but then other people notice after you get in line and there's now 5 people behind you so you've greatly inconvenienced this cashier and they probably hate you. And another worker comes up and tries to make small talk with you but you aren't good at small talk and they make the mistake of asking 'how are you today' and you answer honestly that you are freaking out and why and it just spirals further making it all the worse""

Why. Can't. I. Control. This. Why can't I just say ""oh I'm fine?"" Like a normal person?? And now this post is so long I'm sorry, I'll leave it here. Thank you if you read this far.",mentalhealth,2021-01-24 05:11:06

I moved away from home and am living with my sibling in California, I am 18 and my gender changes I think. 


To explain the background. My parents dont believe in mental health and are strictly religious, when I was 5 my parents denied an autism diagnosis. I dont remember much of my childhood, but my sibling said I spent a lot of time with my parents individually, but not really together. I went to a strongly religious school with 40 kids k-8. I was bullied most of it and my mum(teacher) and the rest of my teachers would deny me getting bullied. I never had many friends, and the one close one I had was toxic af. I switched schools halfway through junior year and went to online school (I dont remember much of this, dif personality was dominant and holds most memories), I recently graduated and got a summer job at a factory 48 hours a week on the night shift. I did that for 3 months and didnt eat for the final month because my parents were on a cult diet and they moved away. I did a decent amount of psychedelics and got addicted to weed(helped quite a few symptoms, but still abuse it). I had a few psychosis episodes at the factory because I hadn't seen anyone but my coworkers in a month. I left my job (as planned) and moved to cali to live with my sibling. I havent been able to get a job since then, and have enough money for 4 more months of rent.

To explain symptoms (undiagnosed, havent been able to get it checked out): ADHD: I have a very hard time focusing in certain tasks that dont capture my attention,  but I can focus for hours on certain tasks. (I show more symptoms but want to be more concise, goes with all other self diagnoses). Autism: I dont understand social cues, I dont have many close friends, I get overstimulated and loud noises, bright lights, and certain textures make me very stressed. DID: I feel very disconnected from my memories, I have at least 3 different known identities (1. Charles: male, typically responsible and denies mental health issues, memories consistent with spending time with dad and high school. 2. Charlie: female, irresponsible stoner who loves nature, leftism, and mental health advocacy, memories consistent with spending time with mum and elementary school. 3. Comrade: genderless, identifies as a sentient logic machine, loves videogames and space, memories consistent with videogames. I am currently Charlie and we share a partial knowledge of our existence, but are unaware of each others intentions and reasonings). 

To explain the issue: I need a job, but I get overstimulated and anxious whenever interacting with people, I cant drive (panic attacks around other cars), and need help/advice with getting a job. I also need help with getting healthcare and health insurance. I applied for medi-cal but they are still processing documents. I dont know any free mental health clinics that aren't quacks. If you know of an organization in America where I can get help, please let me know.


TL;DR: 
I have a lot of problems and was never taught how to do anything, are there any organizations or communities I can get help from?",mentalhealth,2021-01-24 05:30:38

But is getting worse as he's getting older.

He believes his computer is hacked, and people in his apartment building are able to see what he's doing. He'll come over to our house and use his computer because of this.

He believes the powerball is rigged and studies the numbers and sees patterns. He says he doesn't play it that often, and I do believe him as he's low income and couldn't afford to play very much anyway. But he's admitted to spending hours studying the numbers. He is convinced he'll crack it and win soon.

He has more recently become more paranoids about his coworkers, his landlord and people who live in his building. He talks a lot about co workers who only seem to show up for one day and then disappear, he'll talk to them and ask them what kind of hours they work, and they'll tell him they work a few days a week, but he won't see them again for days. He believes this has something to do with people ""watching his PC"" and it's all connected, as if some of these people are just hired by his place of work to watch him.

Back in the 90s and early 2000's, he'd write or email people like Jay Leno and newsrooms. He believed that although he never got replies to his communications, he claims he'd often see ""reactions"" from people in the newsroom, as if they're reading his email. He believed that he became a ""mascot"" for one news organization, and would write these long intricate emails as if everyone there was reading them.

He doesn't seem to have an issue with self importance, because when I ask him why someone or a group would be out to do this he says he has no idea. However, he feels like this may have something to do with his anti-Semitism, and groups he was involving himself with back in the 90s.

He has trouble sleeping, and has often in the past abused ephedrine and uses a lot of caffeine to get through the day. He had a very poor upbringing and was in and out of foster care, and lost a brother to suicide so there's certainly mental health issues in the family.

He always seems fairly wired. He'll often drop things on the floor, forget things. He's forever leaving things at our house. He often walks into things or other people as if watching where he's going isn't a high priority for him. And the man is able to talk for hours on end and has zero concept on overstaying his welcome.

So ultimately I'm wondering how to handle it. He doesn't want to see a doctor about this because he believes it to be a truth and not in his head.

If I can't get him to seek help, should I continue to discuss these issues with him? Or would that be considered to be enabling? I talk a lot with him about computer security. He askes me if it's possible for someone to be watching what he's doing, I explain that sure it's possible if you have software on your PC but someone would have to have had physical access to it, and generally this is only ever done to steal money, not to actually monitor someone.

By talking about this I'm not sure if I'm helping to convince him that some of this is impossible, or if I'm enabling the idea that it could be true. Should I continue what I'm doing, or just refuse to talk to him about it anymore?

Another question I have is, when someone is exhibiting these kind of issues, is it common for them to put a lot of value in their appearance and obsessing over vitamins? He is always very concerned about his weight, to the point where I think he'll go an entire day without eating after splurging. And he's always talking about vitamins, asking me if I've ever heard of a specific vitamin, insisting I look it up and to research it and see what I think about it.

So yeah I'm just looking for a little direction on where to go from here to try get him some help.

Over time I thought he might just be a jerk until i realized his behavior is always in patterns and I feel he may have adhd or be bipolar and I want to learn how to deal with him rather than lashing out when I'm hurt that he's passive aggressive. Would love tips or resources on how to deal with someone like this. Here are some traits or behaviors I'd like to share:

-he has always been off and on moody between happy and sad but the aggressiveness has increased since his parents immigrated and try to influence how he deals with me or his in laws (my family). I know this is a fact cause his sister's husband feels the same about the parents and a change in his wife since they moved nearby. For example, my husband and I agreed for our baby's birth to be private but changed his mind and called them to the hospital and pressured me to allow them inside and they were all 3 mad at me when I didnt want to follow this new plan I didn't know would happen. I was shy to be exposed and this incident really strained our marriage. In fact since the parents moved here he's more stressed about helping them settle and his mood swings are all over the place. He also tried helping them co sign a home without my knowledge and thankfully I found out in time and it was canceled. We just had the baby, are studying, and not fully settled so I advised him it's a bad decision right now and help them in other ways.

-he has trouble listening when i speak and cuts off almost everything I say

-he just cannot repeat a story clearly if I ask about an event that happened, for example ""what did John tell you about his problem at work"" or something simple

-his moods change a lot from normal, to cheerful, and mostly grumpy with a wall up and doesn't let anyone in

-he's very sensitive and misunderstands that things said are a jab to him. If someone tells him about a mistake even nicely he takes it super personal and will have a grudge for months

-when he's in a bad mood or upset he wont greet the person he's upset with

-many times when I ask a question he'll just mumble something inaudible and walk away. This gets embarrassing if guests see and even have asked me ""is he mad at you?"" I've explained that it embarrasses me and he agrees but it continues.

-on certain topics that annoy him (eating healthy etc) he'll just leave the room",mentalhealth,2021-01-24 06:55:58

Since I was young (around 11/12) I've had imaginary friends and boy/girlfriends and even their families/coworkers etc to make up entire storylines. I used to only do this when I was trying to get to sleep as I've always struggled with sleeping due to intrusive thoughts/stress mostly, but now I've started ""pulling them out"" to destress, if I'm walking somewhere alone, particularly nervous and need to play pretend to feel confident enough and even sometimes because I'm just invested in the story I'm making up and want to know what happens next. I whisper out loud to them and act out reactions to what they say back. I look forward to doing it when I go to bed so I can fall asleep/pretend in peace.

So I really don't know.

Everyday I wake up, I lose interest with most anything. I can barely focus with work. I haven't completed any task my boss gives me. Being in a work from home isnt't helping also. Having no clear divide between work and personal space.

I really don't know what's happenning. This has been going since the lockdown started March of last year. I want to talk and open up as there are still a lot of things in my mind. But I cant. With the fear that everything I say will be taken against me.

I live with my partner who was previously diagnosed with clinical depression. As I try to stand strong for her health, it has taken a huge toll on me. But then I have to take and keep everything for myself.

I made mistakes. Mistakes that ruined her trust, our relationship. Did I learn from them? Yes. Did it change things? Yes. But now, living under that shadow. That every move, every message, every phone notification, email, Slack and whatsapp message checked and monitored. Thus my fear of reaching out to my friends knowing that it will be read. I have stopped using facebook and deleted my Instagram account as was requested previously.

Despite all these, I try my best daily to put a smile on my face, go through my day, make things seem normal for everyone. Not sure if I need help, or if I should just talk to someone. And if I do, who? When the world feels smaller and I can barely breathe.",mentalhealth,2021-01-24 07:22:15

So here is the thing, this is very petty from me and I am pretty sure it is me, because the correct thing would be to ignore and continue on with your life. I end up getting a lot of anger through road rage, in public, when im at the gym, or just anywhere really.

The issue is, I was bullied and ridiculed and abused when I was a kid and growing up, mostly emotional abuse, and even from strangers, but it is the one from strangers that really got to me. complete random strangers telling me I will never amount to anything, or how stupid I am when I was a kid. I still remember this clearly.

Now the issue is, I get angry toward a-hole/D.bag behavior and I associate that with bullying or ""trying"" me. people tailgating, not saying thank you, getting to close to me, not using blinkers, people who stare at me for some reason. I sometimes start throwing hand gesture and open my window give them the why you tail gaiting sign or even go up to them say the proper this is to say your welcome when I open the door or some smart response. Had some guy tailgate me on the slow lane, and I stopped in the middle of the road and starting yelling at him. he passed me flicked me off which made me see red. I started following him telling him to pull over to fight me. he just kept driving. I was debating about following him and finding a spot to get out because I wanted to fight him incredibly bad. Well you get the point. Why cant I just ignore this? Just let it go?

Issue is, I do have a lot to lose and dont want to end up back in prison. Im successful, im not stressed at all except dealing with this kind of behavior and I know any rational person will just ignore and move on, but I cant. Im not sure if its something to do with my past? I also was in MMA for 12 yrs, and currently in the gym as well. father pressuring me to always win the match, so I dont know. Should I rejoin mma or box? Get meds? I dont know. Last thing I want to do is go to prison again from everything I have built up, but seeing red does not help. then I go home and I think about it for about 3 or 4 days straight and get massive headaches. This stress has nothing to do with money, wealth, my job, marriage etc. its just straight up bully type behavior is what I call it

The funny part is, I am incredibly giving and super nice with people I know and my friends. you strike a conversation with me, for the life of me I will never disrespect you, but its strangers I have this aggression towards. Same with my wife, I actually respect her completely and essentially do anything she says. Our relationship is healthy and good. just trying to demonstrate my anger is not from marriage or work/wealth stuff and believe I am good in that sector.

Anyways, what should I do? I mean is there anything I can take? would doctors even prescribe me anything? A psychiatrist? I feel like it is starting to interfere with my life.",mentalhealth,2021-01-24 08:03:30

But the worse of it is when I have to deal with people, negotiating, scolding people, confronting people. I would see them usually having their gaze averted looking down speaking slowly, being silent and i notice that it is discomfort and awkwardness and I would feel anxious and stressed out, I don't know why but I just feel it like it just automatically pop into my mind. In my line of work and having to deal with people, friends and family it is inevitable and i always stressed out and it keeps me up at night even if I try not to think about it. How do I be more apathetic because whenever I make people feel angry, uncomfortable(not my fault) I feel very anxious and the worse thing is it linger in my pain and cause my even more anxiety and sometimes even prevent me from interacting with others.

After I went out to interact with a few more people in January, I almost feel the completely opposite of that negative emotion rush.

I feel like I lost the ability to connect to the people and world around me. 

And also, which is very untypical for me, my sex drive went down to 0. Couldn’t care less about an aspect of my life that was always very present and important for me. 

I could spend all day in bed. I am not more tired than usual but I could just sleep all day long if my alarm wasn’t there.

My partner: M28, history of suicide attempts, depression, anxiety, self harm, anger issues, ADHD

We are almost entirely sure my partner has bipolar.

These are his current symptoms (he's currently ""manic"", we call it this although he's not diagnosed): not sleeping for 1-2 days at a time then only needing a few hours, elated mood, tons of energy, motivated and productive (worked in the garden until midnight in snow just last night, stayed up until 5am), reckless spending, erratic behaviour (jumping out of moving cars), anger, barely eating, fast speech, faster walking, constantly moving/can't stay still, rambling or loses track of what he's saying half way through a sentence, high sex drive, unable to regulate words/volume (says inappropriate things, starts shouting instead of talking when it isn't needed - seems overly excitable)

However last month (until January 2nd when he was admitted to a psychiatric ward after a suicide attempt) his symptoms were the following: sleeping 12-16 hours a day, depressed, lack of self esteem, feeling like everything bad is his fault, anger, no sex drive whatsoever, barely functioning ie doesn't look after himself, feed himself or get anything done, even ""basic"" chores and things he used to enjoy like playing games or watching YouTube. Difficultly concentrating, zones out a lot, has a terrible memory, intrusive thoughts, suicidal ideation and even suicide attempts.

He has attempted to receive treatment on the NHS for over ten years now and still does not have any diagnosis except depression, anxiety and ADHD (this was diagnosed as a child and is currently unmedicated).

How can I help him get a diagnosis? Can a private psychiatrist give us more help than the NHS has been able to so far? I've bought a little diary to keep track of his moods, can this help towards getting a diagnosis? We are so desperate for a diagnosis because he is currently trialling various medications and has tried loads of different types of therapy but having a name for his illness might make it easier to medicate/control.",mentalhealth,2021-01-24 10:23:55

I was diagnosed not so long ago with ADHD and I’m currently waiting for an appointment to get the results certified centrally and thus get on medication. Currently I’m self medicating with caffeine and l-theanine, which kind of works. 

Anyways. On New Year’s Eve I got drunk and I had the worst case of alcohol induced anxiety ever. I read somewhere that alcohol can reduce serotonin levels after digestion and I had racing thoughts, I couldn’t sleep, I literally woke up every 5 minutes and it was the worst feeling ever because I literally could not stop thinking and I felt like my mind was blowing up, it was crazy. 

Please note that I’m not an alcoholic, I only consume alcohol when it’s my friends’ bday, but in 2020 I hardly ever did this due to the pandemic. Due to this situation I am now scared of drinking alcohol because it was such a crazy thing to experience that even thinking about it makes me anxious (okay this was kind of a strech but it does make me stop drinking alcohol completely).

So I was wondering if anyone has experienced the same? Is this because of the reduced serotonin levels? Does it have to do something with my ADHD? Again, I would like to emphasize that currently I’m not taking any medication, in fact on NYE I didn’t even take my usual caffeine - l-theanine combo.",mentalhealth,2021-01-24 10:28:09

Your family thinks your insane, your doctors complain, you try to hide the tears that fall down your crimson cheeks. 

You just want to say goodbye, its useless but otherwise over. You feel like a record that jumps, or a bird who cant sing. Death calls you each night and plays with your heartstrings in your dreams. You sit at a bridge and look at the water forcing its way beneath you, your reflection lit by the moon. You wonder what you did wrong to deserve this fate. A cold steel knife trails your arm and blood drips onto the hardwood floor.

You look at the scars, they shine in the sun. They itch and hurt and the urge returns again. Once a 3 year success reduced to nothing by a traumatic event. You sit and cry, you write your final goodbyes and choose a song to set you to sleep. You wait for the storm to clear but it never does. You realise the fight is useless without reward. You decide its time to say goodbye but the world refuses to let you go.

Which sucks because I have a lot of subjects in college that have to do with math and I actually really enjoy math. My trauma has come from the fact, that my father used to force me to do math tasks before doing anything else. So I would have to wake up and then come straight downstairs and do my tasks before doing literally anything else (e.g. bathroom breaks, eating, etc.).

i spent my entire on edge, anxious that i might get pulled into a social interaction soon. i can't get any rest, i'm tense 24/7 and always exhausted. i constantly have dreams about situations where i embarras myself and so on. i stay at home as much as i can and only go outside when i really have to.

when i'm unlucky and HAVE to talk to a stranger or someone i haven't seen in a while i black out, forget everything, i start feeling dizzy, i can't breathe, i forget how to communicate and have even forgotten my name before. if i'm longer than 3-4 minutes in the situation i get an anxiety attack. i've passed out for a few seconds before and all that because i have to talk to someone about a completely normal thing. i'm 20 so people are usually weirded out and confused since i don't ""act my age"".

i can't do anything on my own and always need someone else to make important calls for me. my mother is the one doing it currently but ONLY because she knows that if i get in trouble shed get in trouble as well. we don't get along at all and she mainly thinks that i'm faking everything. i've been wanting to move out for ages since my living situation is toxic, abusive and not supportive at all but i can't. idk how to survive on my own. idk how to do make calls on my own. i literally wouldn't be able to call an ambulance if i'd need it. the thought alone makes my head spin

i just don't know what to do anymore. i can't stay here neither can i live on my own. i'm literally trapped and i feel worse day by day. i've been told that anxiety never really goes away and that i have to learn living with it, that it'll take years and i don't think i have years. i'm not being dramatic when i say that i feel like dying (i know it's physically not possible). if this is how it'll be forever i just can't. i can't live like this",mentalhealth,2021-01-24 11:19:59

I was 22 at the time and I truthfully filled out the questionnaire regarding mental health. Fresh out of college and still under my parents insurance. I was dealing with the suicide of a close friend and I told them so when they called me up to talk about the results of the questionnaire. They said I probably had PTSD. They referred me to a psychologist, but I didn't immediately set up an appointment. I wasn't in any danger of self-harm or crisis. Had no history of it and I didn't personally feel the my answers on the questionnaire were striking enough to have intervention. I was sort of making peace with myself to finally admit I needed to go.

I found out a week later that my doctor shared the results with my mother. I was pretty shocked by this and disappointed. Disappointed enough I never set up a meeting with the referred psychologist. My friend's suicide left me with severe trust issues. Like, how was I supposed to trust a referral from a doctor who breaches patient-doctor confidentiality.

I want to know if this kind of behavior for doctors are normal? I've already changed to another general physician.

I'll have to go into a bit of background of me for context, and why I'm asking:


___
So I'm 28. Freshly married to the love of my life, and living in our apartment together. Throughout life, I have always been a positive person. I guess it's naturally in me, but I am always am positive, upbeat, and optimistic on most things. I'm not like blindly optimistic, but I always look for the good and maintain that life is short, so enjoy everything I can while I have it.



I have never had a problem with mental health. I saw a therapist once in college after a tough breakup, but it was for one session because I wanted to ask if I was on the path for a good ""mental recovery"" essentially (therapists are wonderful and I think there shouldn't be a stigma even for using them for a ""mental tune-up""). That year-long relationship was honestly one of the most mentally taxing things I've ever experienced without getting into details, and the resulting breakup was the cherry on top of the shit sundae. Before that, I was always positive. But after moving on from that relationship, it really changed me for the better and resulted in my further positive outlooks and overall happiness I experience today. 



And of course like everyone, I stress. Work can be hard, and my boss can be a lite-Satan, but hey; I'm thankful I have employment in these difficult times, and my wife and I are alright. Finances can be tough, but as I said, I always look at the positives and face problems logically and head-on. I don't think I have ever had/have anxiety and can only remember one panic attack I've ever had in my life. 



___


All that being said, there are moments, maybe once a week or twice a week, where my wife and I are settling into bed. And I have sudden panic and it's really bizarre. Lights go off, we lay down, and if on a scale, 0% is wide awake and 100% is completely asleep, I'm maybe like 20% ways to sleeping, for context. I'm still very much awake, but I'm on the verse of starting to doze. And suddenly I just get stricken with fear, usually in the sense of a tragedy or loss.



Last night I had it, prompting this post. As the above says, we were going to sleep, but I just had a sudden moment of ""what if my wife dies in a car accident tomorrow? [Wife] drives 25 minutes to work one way, and takes a majority of highway. What if someone cuts her off and she dies? I don't know how if I'd be able to handle that. What if she is going to her car at night and someone mugs her, it goes south and she gets murdered or assaulted? When we eventually get a house, what if we are the victims of a home invasion?""



Shit like that. Just a bunch of dreaded scenarios. Not like I am having a panic attack, or my heart races. My heartrate stays the same and everything, my mind goes in that direction. I rarely or never have these thoughts during the day, but even if I do, I can easily be logical and say ""Our cars are good, she's a great driver, and we work and live in safe neighborhoods. We have doors locked, security, and the chances of those things are very low anyway"". And as soon as I'm up in the morning, I realize how illogical and panic-stricken I was for absolutely no reason, and it doesn't even hold a place in my mind then. But for some reason at night, that ""logical"" part of my mind is on the back burner. 




Anyone else experience anything like that? Is that, for lack of a better term, ""normal?"". Just wanted some opinions on it.",mentalhealth,2021-01-24 11:50:41

I really need your opinion.

So everyone at work knows that I’m a girl who’s obsessed with working out, flexibility and being healthy. I used to always talk about how my ultimate flexibility goal was to get my splits and I was working on them since 2019 but last year during quarantine I had a huge downfall and I was dealing with mental health issues and stopped completely. 

I’ve been friends with this girl since 2019, she’s also my coworker, she’s never been into working out, flexibility or anything fitness related. I noticed over the last 2 years that she started copying me (my healthy lifestyle, my diet, started working out too, the way I dress, talk...etc) It never really bothered me I felt happy that I was influencing someone’s life in a positive way.

I recently found out that she GOT HER SPLITS. Apparently she’s been working on them during quarantine which is great for her. But she NEVER mentioned it to me nor did she ask me for tips or advice or anything knowing that It was my dream and I was working on it for a long time. She went and copied my goal and worked on it in SILENCE.

When I asked her why she didn’t tell me, she smiled and said “I didn’t want you to feel inferior”!!!!! This completely shocked me! Does she feel superior because of this ? I would have honestly been so happy to help her if she told me I inspired her to get the splits too.

This shook my self esteem so much and I have been crying everytime I get reminded of it. I just feel so stupid for considering her a close friend and telling her about my own personal goals and personal life. But she didn’t even bother to tell me something that clearly means so much to me. I can’t even work on my splits as I used to because I feel defeated. And on top of that she thinks I must feel inferior. I feel so uncomfortable around her and Everytime I see her at work, I get reminded of this and be miserable. 

We also go to the same gym, and I feel she gets a bit competitive when she works out with me. 
Unfortunately, I’m a very sensitive person and a big overthinker so I let it get to me so much. I pretend that everything is okay when I’m with her but I’m miserable inside. I wish I can quit my current job but I can’t.

Am I a bad person for feeling like this ?",mentalhealth,2021-01-24 11:52:25

I’ve been here for just a month and I want to kill myself. Not literally, but I don’t know how else to describe these feelings... and now I feel stuck.

Where to go? What to do next? I really don’t know.

Is there someone else out there who have been through the same struggle?",mentalhealth,2021-01-24 12:08:33

I’d been carrying on for a few hours as well, as of it was a normal work day. I’ve been a little fuzzy at times in general and I wonder if there’s a bigger issue to worry about - I have depression but I’m not on medication and can’t concentrate sometimes.

Basically every waking moment I have is spent feeling constantly fatigued , like even the effort of doing basic tasks or self-care are so mentally draining and exhausting. Not because I don’t want to do these things as I will eventually force myself to do them but my body physically just feels so terrible - I feel physically ill all the time my only escape is sleep. I am a healthy weight , eat decently well , drink plenty water do not smoke cigarettes or drink and only smoke weed. I also have a highly physical job and only sit down on my breaks. 

Mentally it’s tough and that’s why the only hope I have for my life right now is that I one day won’t feel like this anymore. I’ve felt this for a few months but it’s gotten progressively worse - doing even home schooling is a monumentous task. 

Sometimes I get bursts of energy and some days I almost feel normal. But this doesn’t last long.

We patched things up and seemed to be getting along, but I noticed later on that I only ever was miserable around her and vice versa. We never talked about happy things and I'm not saying being miserable with a friend means the friendship is bad, but if all you're ever talking about is sad things well... it's not a stable one. So after I she accused me of being a bad friend for never talking about her... which I did all the time and brought this up along with how much I knew about her. She proceeds to insult me and what not and this was before I checked myself into a hospital.

I had to check into a mental hospital again because of a mental breakdown I noticed I was having and wanted to stop before I hurt anyone again. I told her and she insulted me before I left. I got in contact with her a few days later and well...

She didn't ask how I was doing, where I been, nothing just was like ""What are we doing?"" and I agreed and decided we needed some space and she like backflipped and accused me of being and acting weird how I was the problem and something was wrong with me. This is after I told her I left the hospital and had mental breakdown! I explained my reasoning, that I didn't feel like our friendship was strong and maybe we need to stop before someone got hurt. She then proceeds to gaslight me and call me names which resulted in me losing my temper and blocking her for good. I don't think I'll unblock her either, might delete her number... I'm not here asking am I in the wrong, I'm just recounting my story and how heartbroken I am to lose a friend. Especially after losing so many because of my own fault.

I was the problem too though in this situation because all it ever seemed we talked about was terrible things and never really gave each other words of encouragement. I wish I could go back in time and change things, but for now it's best if I go onto greener pastures as they say.

I have what i'm pretty sure is severe depression. I struggle to just get through the day, it takes all my energy to just take care of myself and do a few basic chores. Sometimes I can't get out of bed and have to sleep to escape the urge to die. I struggle often with hopeless, depressed and suicidal thoughts. I'm very grateful to be able to live with my parents and have their financial support, and I know that I am lucky to have this, but it takes literally all my energy to just get through the day and stay alive, i'm often in a constant of emotional pain and can't do much else. I just don't have access to mental healthcare because there's a lot of stigma for it in this country, and though my mom has suggested that she is open to looking, she is also super religious and always defaults to that. It's like pushing a boulder up a hill to get her to really listen to me and it always goes back to 'drink water', 'sleep well', 'exercise' when it takes all my energy to just ATTEMPT to do these things. I'm also gay/trans and closeted because my family is homophobic and transphobic, and live in a country where these things are illegal and I can't be out and live safely. I look for help online and it's always either the same advice or someone telling me to get help which I don't have access to. I buy a CBT workbook and it's just callous and insensitive and implies that I just have to think positive and am irrational and stupid for having hopeless thoughts and that I can just reason my way out of being depressed.

I've scrounged up all my time and energy into self-help and trying to remedy my own depression for YEARS and it's barely worked, i'm still depressed. And it hurts more than anything when I constantly hear online therapists and psychiatrists and other depressed people say that I just need to realize that the world isn't that bad and people care about me and just think positive. The world is horrible and unsafe if I want to live openly as myself, the people around me barely care if they hate me for my gender/sexuality and I can tell them i'm depressed over and over and they can keep telling me to just 'try harder' and 'pray', and even if I know some things are good for me and i'm lucky in a lot of ways, it doesn't take away the emotional pain I feel every day and just makes me feel guilty that I can't help but struggle this much when I have so much. I'm just tired and frustrated and hopeless. I need someone to tell me that i'm not insane for feeling this way, instead of being constantly told that my fears and pain is irrational and stupid and I should just try harder. I'm tired of being condescended to. I'm tired of trying when it feels like it amounts to nothing and i'm tired of feeling like a useless person who doesn't contribute anything to the world when I desperately want to.",mentalhealth,2021-01-24 12:27:59

This issue has been plaguing me for the last 3 years, and it’s worsening my existing mental health issues. I am afraid to tell my dad I don’t want to do university anymore. I don’t even really know why, I am 21 years old, I live by my self now and I’m able to support myself through my job and doing graphic design on the side. 

I hate school, I’ve never liked school. I was always bullied and never had friends, never had a passion for it. I’m not enrolled right now and I honestly have no intention of going back, even finishing my degree would not help me for what I want to do.

When I was 17 I escaped my abusive mother and her partner, originally thinking that going to school in my dads home town would be the only way for me to leave. When I got here and started university, I was hit with a whole bunch of pressure from my family about finishing school. I was treated like some golden child being the first of my generation to go to university. I even convinced myself for a while it was what I needed to do, but I quickly realized I hated it and I didn’t want to be there.

My dream is to run an online business and be a content creator and I am taking steps every day to push me forward to that goal, I feel like I am well on my way and have made good progress so far. Although I still feel as if he will be disappointed and might cut me off. I think that it the main thing I am afraid of, I haven’t spoken to my mother in almost 5 years, or my siblings that are from her. I recently lost my grandfather who was like my father when I was growing up since I didn’t see my dad much. I feel like ive lost everything and I an afraid of losing him too because of this.

Now it has finally caught up to me and I live day to day in complete sadness, feeling hopeless, and unknowing of what to do next. 

From being a toddler up to high school I was abused in all ways. Mentally, physically, sexually, emotionally. In high school I was never officially diagnosed but always showed signs of ADHD, OCD, and depression. No idea what I wanted to do with my life, someone mentioned healthcare, I said why not. I got a worthless bachelors of science, did a year and a half of grad school in a field of direct patient care and all of sudden my mental health plummeted. I always had great grades in college when I applied myself. I always did better than average and I mean hell, I got into graduate school! Made everyone in my life so proud, but then I began to feel bored, miserable, and depressed. So much so I hated seeing patients on my clinic hours, I became angry and hateful towards everyone around me, and all of this bled out into my home life as well. I had this overwhelming feeling of I've done everything I've wanted, learned what I wanted, and now I no longer what to be here. For health reasons I took a leave from my program and that lead to not returning at all. 

I then went to work at a hospital, thinking I would become a nurse. The same cycle happened all over again, but luckily I wasn't back into another college program yet. I became depressed, angry, miserable, hating everyone around me, but this time what made me leave this career path was my s/o got a dream job offer and together we moved. 

I now work a internal corporate recruiting job, making awful pay. I am in a mountain of student debt. I was fortunate to come across a educational program that allows me to get my degree in IT while I work full time and the cost is pocket change, but my life is truly going nowhere. My OCD and ADHD like symptoms are now the worst they have ever been. I am getting help but no diagnosis has been given and I am on no medication. The cycles of going all in to something, becoming so mentally crushed, and then leaving what I started has ruined my life. I used to be somewhat optimistic, but now my days are just filled with sadness and I feel like there is this fog in between myself mentally and reality. I know I have done this to myself but I don't ever see myself having a positive quality of life.

I was in a really bad rut before I came here. I dropped out of college a year prior and planned to get a license and a job to help myself gain some work experience, but then COVID happened and because my mother is highly vulnerable I had no choice but to give up my hope of finding a job and getting my license (I can’t go to the dmv). The worst part is that my parents keep acting as though I’m such a do nothing when I’ve been thoroughly trapped at home contemplating how I’m going to return to college after so long. It was really hard being locked away in my room with parents I don’t want to fight but wish I could and friends who don’t seem to care much about my mental state.

I decided to make a Reddit because I thought it would be fun to post my art and other thoughts somewhere and also because I want to learn to take criticism and input about my art and ideas better (considering I come from a background that taught me to always be”perfect” and caused me to be heavily insecure and bad at taking criticism). As soon as I started posting my art tho it started blowing up like crazy with tons of comments all the time. It’s been overwhelmingly positive with even some of her criticisms being genuine and stinging less than I was expecting, but my mind is still disoriented.

I guess it was because I was brought up to expect the worse so I’m always on edge that someone’s gonna say they hate me or my stuff at any moment. In that regard, however, It doesn’t mean I’m still not happy with the results I currently have. Most people on this platform seem to genuinely find what I post enjoyable and the responses I got have made me feel more appreciated than I have been in recent months and even the past year.

I just wanted to share this experience because I’m still unsure how exactly I feel about everything. I’m still afraid, but I’m hopeful and kind of excited to see what’s to come. Despite my fear, I haven’t felt this good about myself in a long long time.",mentalhealth,2021-01-24 13:00:40

I try to reply and answer people’s questions in hopes of bringing some type of understanding or happiness with how they are feeling... it’s weird because Im giving all this advice while gradually getting worse my self.. 

I keep telling my self to stay positive.. that things are going to get better. I try to do things like buy nice new cloths and get all dressed up to take myself out to dinner on my own. I sit down and have some food and drinks with myself and try really hard to be happy.. but this mask I’m building is rapidly breaking down and I don’t think I can hold it all in any longer.

I’ve been through therapy since I was a child.. and here I am at 27, still in therapy. And I definitely have an understanding of my mental health. I know how to maneuver my depression and deal with my sadness. I understand that it’s okay to feel these things I feel. I finally have come to terms with things in my past like my attempts on my own life. Yet.. I still feel like everything I have done and all the work I have put in, is all for nothing. 

I recently found someone who has been able to make me break down my walls.. someone who has made me want to actually be vulnerable and actually try to be the man I want to be. And in this time that we had each other I learned how to finally give my self the love and happiness I deserve. The love that I had pouring out of me, which was something I have never felt before, made me finally realize the things I want in life. The feeling brought me so much joy and happiness that I finally felt like I achieved something amazing. A feeling of self understanding and self love and like I’m top of a mountain. Now I’m obviously never going to forget what I’ve been through and that I had felt the way I did before hand. But I learned to be okay with it on a level that made me finally find some type of peace. 

Now, this person is no longer in my life. At least no where near as much as they were. I understand that this person had to leave to help and heal their own mind.. I understand that they have been feeling some type of way with their mental health.. and that they feel that the only way to help themselves is to leave and be in their own. I get it. And of course with all the unconditional love and respect I have for this person I will support their decisions and I’ll always love them.. even if it’s from a far. But now... this great feeling I had for myself is slowly being stripped back. I’m trying to stay positive and understand that this newfound love for myself was all caused by me and my own happiness.. but now I feel like I’m on this mountain of new gained sanity and I have no one to share it with.  losing this person is tearing me apart.. All of these negative thoughts that are always so intrusive in my life are finally breaking lose from their chains and coming at me in full force. I feel like losing this person is just the universe giving me karma for everything I have done in my past... that I don’t deserve this person who I whole heartedly felt was the most amazing, awesome, and beautiful person in this entire galaxy. This person was just so fantastic to me. I mean just being in their presence for the amount of time that I was, made me change for the better! 

I’m trying so hard not to revert back to my sad, depressive self. But I feel like everything is just going against me. That anytime I try to find happiness.. it’s ripped away from me. That I’m never gonna be alright because I just.. don’t deserve it. Every time I try... and lord knows I really tried. I tried as hard as I possibly could this time. I put my heart and soul into everything I did.. yet here I am writing this. Maybe the phrase “nice guys finish last” is the truth. I’m tired of everything crumbling around me when I try. I’m tired of being negative. I’m tired of trying to find happiness.. I’m tired of life. Things just don’t make any sense to me anymore. We all try so hard but a lot of us just keep getting our faces shoved back in the dirt. 

Is there really some Devine plan for us... cuz if so this plan sucks. Or are we the cause of our own problems..  are we the ones standing in our own way. I’m trying so hard to understand. Why do we try hard for so long but get no outcome.. sometimes it feels like the harder we try the harder we fall. And this time.. the fall is long and hard.. 

Just wanted to vent for a bit. Thanks to anyone who took the time to read this post.. I hope you all find what you’re looking for in the end.",mentalhealth,2021-01-24 13:16:03

And I honestly didn't feel any reaction at all. I mean, I would certainly be somehow sad about it, but I wouldn't miss anything. There's no emotional bond between me and my parents. They were nice and did stuff with me, went to all my sports events and told me, that they like me, but somehow I never could come to them and talk to them about my problems or when I was sad or embarrassed. I was depressed for four years in my teen years and felt left alone by them, felt like they weren't interested whether I was alive or dead. 

Now, that I'm not living at home anymore, I don't miss anything ever, I have no idea what to talk about with them. I am grateful for everything they did for me, but somehow, something's missing.

The truth about women is that they are all the same. Women are nothing more than shallow, materialistic, and harsh creatures. Women choose their partners based on their shallow perceived traits, and will always have the privilege to make cruel attacks, whether through signals or directly, whenever they are asked out by unfortunate, inflicted and aggrieved men. If you don't have a certain trait or ability that the girl wants, then good luck chasing her because she will bully you with her friends for the rest of your life for doing that (someone actually did this to me).

I find it curious how for so many years men have not spoken up about the inherent dark and toxic nature of women in general. It is this dark and toxic nature that drives them to ruthlessly and inhumanely judge men by their looks and outward appearance, and despite whatever lies you have been fed, no they do not pick and choose by inner qualities. From my experience, all they did was laugh when one of them poked fun at my appearance. And thought it was funny when they visibly wanted nothing to do with me, all chasing after any other man other than myself. And just to further prove this argument, I once recall a time in my life where every woman in the classroom would totally ignore me. Even when I looked in a direction and did not even make eye contact with them, they used the passive-aggressive signal of immediately looking away in a rude and disrespectful manner. When I brought this up in conversation to another woman, she confirmed herself that it WAS rude. Also, just to illustrate how deep my pain and trauma goes, I recount one of the women in that same time had later tried to act empathetic to my pain right after she heard that I was recently doing well in my school subjects. Coincidence? I think not. That was the only thing that was ever good about me in her eyes. If I had known the truth as I do now in my depressing reflections on reality, I would probably have chose to fake a relationship with her as she did with me. Then, on a well-planned time and date, I would stab myself in the heart when talking to her. Only then would they begin to realize the evil and injustice they are a part of.

This is not the only piece of evidence that backs my facts up. The banal fact is that humans share 99% of our DNA with chimpanzees. We are animals, and the selection of partners based on external, material qualities and that is a FACT. You as a woman can lie about how women judge by personality, quality, e.t.c. but I have already come to the stark realization that such a purported act is either dishonestly so, or is trivial for the most part. Most importantly, it is funny how not once in my life have I met a personality-oriented woman in my life, the lie which they brought up time and time again. And almost all of the remaining women did judge me based on my appearance. They made harsh, cruel signals communicating to me that I'm repulsive, and just to validate this point further, many of them even said directly to my face some very unjustifiably harsh remarks about my face, body, e.t.c. I therefore stand with the fact that women are a great source of evil and justice in this world. My depression, low-self esteem, hurt, and self-hatred worsens as they laugh in hedonistic, evil pleasure.

The truth is that I feel traumatized. The truth is that I feel broken. Now in every action I undertake, in every dream I follow, I always feel drained of energy. I can't seem to forget all the times they hurt me and got away with it.

Why do I only shed a negative light on women, when men can be the same? Here is why. Nikola Tesla, the main Einstein called the smartest man in the world, predicted the future to be one where the woman will have power over men and select men based on their personal desires. He made this prediction alongside wireless communication, cell phones, the internet and many other innovations, all of which turned out to be true and with startling accuracy! So I think I'll trust the world's smartest man on the fact that the future will not be so bright after all.

If my misfortune is a result of karma, then I must have been a treacherous, thieving, criminal, someone who committed very inexplicable and unthinkable things which were of great detriment to others. Even if I do change into a man that every woman covets, the pain of the past and knowledge of the present/future still wrankles, and what I have to say below would always stick.

If this is the world that men and women must live in, then I would surely wish for it to end soon, especially on my end.

My life and its countless experiences of trauma, gaslighting, abuse as a child, racism and bullying make a great example to the world that God should destroy it very soon.",mentalhealth,2021-01-24 14:03:50

I didn't know where to post this or even how to approach the subject without feeling obsessive or ""crazy"" so I did a search and found this subreddit. I figured I'd share what's been going on and get tips or atleast some reassurance that I am not alone in this thinking.

I've always had really bad anxiety. Everyone has a past and I'm attributing most of my anxiety to those events. Anyhow, I've noticed my health anxiety has been through the roof due to the pandemic. I'm pretty excessive about washing my hands, sanitizing, and wearing masks. I've even started obsessively asking my SO if he's washed his hands or is going to wear a mask if he goes out. (He always does, regardless, I always ask.) He has an autoimmune disease so I worry about that. I also worry about getting COVID because no one really knows how it affects us. (I guess I should also mention my mom is a nurse working a COVID ward and one of his parents is a doctor. I'm not sure if that has any significance, though it may so I decided to include that information.)

All of last year the option of teleworking was there until I transferred to a different department where I have to be in the office everyday for at least 8 hours.  We have our own offices and masks are required when you are in contact with others but not in our offices. I've been wearing my n95 all day not including my breaks or lunch, which I spend in my car. (I'm prone to allergies/sinus problems so my nose has been stuffed up, I've experienced sore throats, and runny nose all week.) Even though my rational mind says ""there is no way you contracted this, you are literally OVERBOARD CAREFUL"", I'm still afraid. Every time I cough, clearing my throat, or sore throat makes me on edge. If I have to blow my nose, I get anxious. If I have to take a deep breath, I immediately check my blood oxygen level. I'm exhausted and I hardly get any sleep. I've also been checking my temperature when I wake up and before bed and if something is just SLIGHTLY off, I automatically think, ""well you're f\*\*ked"" because that should read 97.7 not 98.2. (Completely NORMAL, I know, but I am usually between 97.7-98.0. and it's NOT that I don't know, I know your physiology varies because of environmental factors, I just start to panic.) I even try to exercise everyday, but as of starting this new job, I missed 4 days because the commute is not something I'm used to. I went from teleworking since March mostly to an almost 45 minute commute everyday. I'm really tired.

I don't know what to do and I can't be worried about this 24/7 anymore. What do I do? I'm not depressed, I'm just literally afraid to get this virus. I know the weather has a lot to do with why my sinuses are so bad lately, but Jesus, what happens if I do get it? Am I just going to freak out and have a heart attack? 

If anyone can suggest anything, I would greatly appreciate it.

Normally when this happens (once every few months or so), the next day I feel better. Sometimes you just have to feel your feelings ya know? This has been happening more frequent than usual (three times in the past two weeks). 

This time I’m not coming out of it. Im crying again today. I feel hopeless, unlovable, sad, I feel like I’m going no where in my life and that I’ve been through TOO much to overcome my obstacles. I feel like I have no support and no one to talk to about any of this. My brain just feels weird and off and I’m sure there’s a name for this feeling but I have no idea what it is. A little like an out of body experience or maybe I’m just extremely overwhelmed by all these extreme emotions.

And then highschool I don't remember either, I remember classrooms and faces of people. But aside from a few people, I don't actually *remember* them, if that makes sense.

And besides that I don't remember anything in my life, the few things that I do remember are usually bad things like regrets or my parents yelling at me, so I rather don't remember them actually.. The only thing that seems to get stuck in my head is stuff I need to know for an exam or something tho I forget those right after the exam as well.

She does this too when she's yelling at me. It's like every problem she has is somehow our fault. Something goes missing? It's definitely our fault. Parents arguing? Our fault. She's crying because her husband is an asshole and a piece of shit? My fault for not comforting her. It's not like she deserves it anyway. 

The reason I'm posting this on r/mentalhealth is that her constant verbal and sometimes physical abuse has taken a toll on me. I feel less motivated to do any homework because in her mind, I'm a big fat failure and I'm always reminded of that. Although I've been doing well until a 1 year ago when this pandemic wasn't in place. School used to be an escape from home. Now, I don't even want to do anything pertaining school anymore. I just want to die. The only thing that's kept me living is anime and manga. It's a silly reason but really, I'm still here haha. 

But, there's more. I've been picking my skin for who knows how long now and mother dearest decides that it's not a serious health issue and just yells at me for hours nonstop to stop this behavior when I've tried several times to but I just can't. It would've been fine if she just screamed at me to stop but oh no, she takes it a step further by calling me ugly and the ugliest in my class and how I won't get a man (little does she know I've been dating without her knowing :P) besides yelling at me for 100 million other reasons not relating to the matter as well. It's gotten to the point where she beats me. Like, I'm sorry for being hella sexy and you're just jealous. This problem could've been resolved if she took me to a doctor years ago. And she wonders why I stay cooped up in my room instead of conversing with her. I swear, she gets mad at the littlest of things and it's an every day cycle. I'm sorry that I'm passive aggressive but really, I want her out of my goddam life! I hate that woman with all my heart and I'm not afraid to let it out and tell the world what kind of a person she is. 

I remember reading something on the internet that said something about parents trying their best to raise their child but still be terrible parents. That describes my mother perfectly. I don't think she should've had children if she is going to release all her anger out on them but it's too late to abort :/. 

I've been trying to better myself my organizing a schedule to do homework and study  and trying to cut down the skin picking as best as I could. 

If you're deciding to have children or already do, please don't yell at them for unreasonable things or when they do something wrong. Sit them down and have a talk with them about what they did wrong and how to improve themselves. This is common knowledge. Unfortunately, some choose not to listen and that might result in their child not loving them.

My cousin (who is like a brother to me) was diagnosed with BPD in February of 2020. He was taking his medication in the beginning but didn't like how it made him feel and stopped taking it. He is a very gullible person so he believes everything that he reads on the internet. He is convinced that he can't take his medication because it is going to kill him, this info he got from a Joe Rogan Podcast. He gets all his news and world info from YouTube pretty much. He dropped out of school in his last month and has quit several jobs since then because he ""hates"" people and doesn't want to be around them anymore. He has stopped talking to his mom who is the only one that has tried to be helpful and has since moved in with his dad who does the very minimum of making sure thats he's still alive.

For the past 5 months he has been living at his dad's house sitting in his room on his computer reading about everything wrong with the world, refusing to take his medication, and looking for ways to end it all, because he has no hope for the world or reason to live. Everyone has tried to speak to him about getting help, or taking his medication, or even just trying to help him be happier in his current state, but he doesn't want any of that. I've never seen such negativity before in my life. He finds every reason in the world to convince himself otherwise of any idea of finding a job or going somewhere far away from others. He doesn't want to work for anyone ever again, he hates everyone including his family, has no concern for his own well being and just wants to die. Legally there is nothing we can do to ""force"" him to get help from somewhere so we're basically just waiting on him to suddenly have a change of heart or mindset, or take his own life. It is the worst waiting game I have ever played. Everyone in the family has mentally prepared themselves for the inevitable ending because we have tried everything in our power to help him but he just doesn't want it. He doesn't think a single thing is wrong with him. He has manic episodes were he starts to break things in the house. He has deactivated all his social media and broke his phone so that nobody can reach him. Only way I am able to talk to him is via email. I have convinced him to play video games the past two days with me which has distracted him from all his negative thoughts, but every single thing that I try to talk about that could be remotely positive, he just shoots down and tells me why is actually the worst thing in the world.

I don't know if I am here to vent or looking for advice. I am just so lost and I don't know what to do. I know there is nothing that I can do, but its just so hard to sit there and watch his life crumble around him until he decides that he can't take it anymore.

I'm sorry if some of this seemed ignorant or made no sense. I have done a fair amount of reading on BPD trying to understand it more and how his mind might be functioning, but there is still a lot I don't know.

My brain aches awake. I'm scared to make mistakes, my body is cut, bruised and my smile is a fake. My mornings are short, my nights seem eternal. 

My friend, I am scared, I need a reason to stay. The voices they scream, the people they seem so scared and bleak. They call me to end my life so they can live. A choice to be made, to live here in pain, or to die and be free. 

But the world won't let me be. Life is painful, and otherwise over. Yeah, life it is painful, and may well be over. 

Verse 2:
My scars, they shine bright. My knife shines like crazy, I catch a glimpse of my eye. A tear down my cheek, I can't make this week. I'm scared, oh god save me I swear. 

I think to my youth, where others played and rode bikes, I tried to hang myself with bendy twigs, an accident it would seem. But fail back then as I do now. 

This life is lonely, and otherwise over. Life is painful, may as well be over. The past haunts me now, please let it be over. 

Verse 3:
I beg those who can, I beg them for help. They tell me there's a process and it's not an easy fix. I cry to myself, please let this end now. I'm scared and alone please let me be now. 

This life is painful, but won't be over. It's useless to fight, but I can't let it be over. The world it is cruel, won't let it be over.",mentalhealth,2021-01-24 14:56:43

English is not my first language, so please forgive my spelling mistakes.

&amp;#x200B;

Backround: I  have never told anyone about my feelings, because I know it'd make everything in my life worse worse. I'm 17, so I know I would either be thrown in an institution or all I spilled out would be brushed under the rug.  I'm in my second year of high school (lasts 3 years where I live), and don't really do much with my free time.

I've always been the  ""poster child"", good at school, well behaved etc. But as I've gotten older my mental health has gone horrifically downhill. I can't function normally anymore, and all the things that make me happy are my triggers-with everything else around me. Every single thing in my everyday life is making me so anxious worried.  I have two much younger siblings with learning disabilities, and because of this I feel like I have to be perfect. I have to be the child that succeeds, because I know my sibling might never be able to. I want to paint a picture of being the perfect daughter, that doesn't have anything wrong with her, and will make her parents proud. I feel like i can't take any breaks from anything, or I'll be a disappointing slob.

So.

I feel like I have no safe space for me, where I'm not stressed or anxious. My grades have dropped from the top of my class to barely passing the subjects I would need in university. I have lost all my sense to focus, and can't do anything for prolonged periods of time. 

I had my future planned out a few years ago when I left middle school, but now I'm lost. I'm not good enough to get to the university I want, and I can't seem to better myself. I feel like my future has already disappeared at this point, and I'll become a disappointment. Never having a job or a family of my own to be proud of. 

I know my mom has suffered through depression, and has always told me about it and how she doesn't want me to end up like her. She is a narcissistic hoarder, and has done nothing with her life until now. And I'm afraid I'll turn out like her. I want to be good and make her proud of me. I want to be able to say I have done something with my life. But I feel too lost  and see myself in her, about to turn up like her. Has anyone gone through with something like this, and if you have please tell me how it turned out. I want to have even some reassurance that things might turn out OK, and I might be able to still become something at this point.

So since September my mental health has been so rocky and complicated. I know everyone has their bad days but this isn’t just bad days. It’s like every week my mental health is completely different. One week I’m completely fine and I’m like me, the next I have horrible anxiety, and then I suddenly obsess about all my past mistakes for a week and then I get these horrible intrusive thoughts about hurting people. 

I tried birth control in October for a month but the last three days I was just crying for hours and I just had these suicidal thoughts. It freaked me out so much I just decided to stop taking it. 

I’ve noticed that ovulation is usually when my mental health completely messes up and I obsess over the past and I get the horrible intrusive thoughts. And then the week before my period I’m completely fine and like me. All I want is to be okay again and I’m not sure what to do. I’m worried it’s going to ruin my relationship because when my mood goes strange and I can’t be rational, my feelings for him usually disappear and don’t return until I’m finally okay. 

The intrusive thoughts are getting worse and they only begun in September, when I say worse I mean it’s more difficult to get them out of my head.

I've been trying to cook and bake more, now that I'm living somewhere with an oven/full kitchen, but I keep fucking up the recipes and my roommates have to swoop in to help me. I have literally not gotten through one without something being a disaster. It's entirely something on my end too. I'll have read the recipe 3 times over and somehow missed that there was an ingredient we don't have, for example, or I'll put a pie shell in without knowing that I was supposed to put a tray on the next rack down. Same with sewing- I keep making things and there keeps being something that I measured or calculated wrong despite me checking and checking and checking it. 

It's such a roadblock- I'd like to try and develop some confidence, but I can't do that without having positive thoughts about myself, and I can't get to that phase with this glaring problem in my way that keeps getting worse. I just want to be at the level most people are at.

I don't know if this is the right place to post my troubles, but I hope it is really.

So here's the thing.

I noticed that at times my head feels heavy like I have some slight pressure on my neck.

Also, I have problems concentrating during the day and my motivation can below.

I, for example, want to learn something of interest, but every time I sit down at the computer I feel distracted or suddenly become uninterested in what I wanted to do. Sometimes I have to try harder to accomplish simple tasks, such as sending e-mail messages about something important to my commercialist, call a customer to pick a device from repair, etc...

In the mornings I feel slow and sluggish and that affects my ability to work at full capacity. Sometimes I delay some tasks that are only five minutes long to complete.

I become mentally tired after speaking with just one person for 15 minutes.

I feel lost, and for example a few years ago while doing the same job, I had much more energy and was able to work with 3 computers in the repair shop (example, installing software on one, running diagnostics on another, and finishing touch on the third one that was almost done.

I lost that sharpness, I miss that ability to concentrate like Sherlock :) that I had a few years ago.

Now, most of the time I jump from task to task, feel tired, low energy, and motivation for things. When laying in bed at certain times I question the meaning of life and what is the purpose in all of it. It's not like I want to end it but, it just does not make sense anymore. And gaining weight due to covid lockdown also had a high impact on me in terms of bothering me and having trouble losing it.

I did an online ADHD test - says I have it but it cannot replace a doctor's diagnosis.

I don't know if it means something, last year I was on prescription drugs for depressive anxiety disorder for 6 months, due to my divorce caused by my toxic ex-wife with severe mental problems and schizophrenic behavior I had to put up for three years.

If anyone can give some advice or has some suggestion for me, please do so I would be really grateful. Here where I live, you just can't talk to anyone about this, because most of the people don't simply care or will gossip about it because they are uneducated and will go around thinking you just another crazy bastard that mother nature has played with.

I had to wait months before I got an initial assessment date. And then when the day happened they had to cancel due to an emergency(but still fitting lmfao). But anyways last week I attended the rescheduled appointment and to my surprise it was quite the pleasure. The first thing the lady said when I answered the call was “I wanna make this as painless as possible” and that gave me some sort of hope that this place might have something for me, finally. They said it’d be about a week and a half before they get back to me. And the anticipation of “what if they have nothing” keeps getting worse by the minute. At this point in my life the mixture of paranoia and apathy almost contradicts itself. I just can’t help but be in awe that I’m still here dealing with this shit. I’ve said this before and I’ll say it again schizophrenia has aged my mind up past numbers. I feel aged and used and I should be turning 19 this year but I keep convincing myself I won’t make it, every year I do this And every year I make it. And these past few times it hasn’t been as bad. But it still hurts. To feel like a genetic dead end. A neurological guinea pig. To have to humanize yourself and for what just to be treated like less than because “no schizophrenic should ever be this articulate are you sure you’re not faking???” I am so beyond frustrated and exhausted. I wish it was easier in so many ways for so many folks I keep thinking that maybe I was born to early. But at the very least if I have to live this life going about it being a certified unknown. I would like to think that some time in the future there will be better access to treatment and diagnosis for schizophrenic children. That way they don’t have to normalize horrid things as just childhood imagination and something everybody else goes through because “the mind is a powerful thing and it can play tricks on anyone” I am going to keep going but I am very honest that I wish I never had to do any of this. I wouldn’t be me without that truth. This wouldn’t be my story. I couldn’t paint this picture without those colors. It feels like all my brain does these days is freak out and then play dead. This is a harsh reality and it’s even harsher on the days where I truly want to feel alive. The guarantee of a future isn’t always a good thing. But it’s something and it’s all I have.

But it wasn't easy. I just looking for advice or something. I don't know if I can ask it here or not but I just looked at the thread and it said mental health but if it's not allowed then. I tried I guess. Anyway. I have been rather on a wierd side of my life but old memories and things I've been through still brings my self worth down. I'll try to keep mostly short. In my early years. I have been missing alot of things that I really want but it feels like the wound of it is too big to be patched. I have a depressed dad and a mother occasionally cares. Alot of things happened reaching teen. From emotional neglect, manipulation which made me into a person who overthinks alot and gets worried alot. Putting my own problems as low as possible and putting others up. I tried alot to get my parents help at a young age. At my school multiple times there was a say campaign where the person advices us as teens and stuff. And at the end we are to write a letter for our parents on how we are and things. Multiple times had I given mine to my mother and my dad. Dad couldn't care and my mother brushed it away looking at the other children. (At the time there was a kid who didn't see their mother in a long time. It intrigued her more than me. And this was in middle school) I had been most alone in my years. Being in school I hated it. I've been forced to study subjects I did not want to. Stressed early on for 2 full years. My grades was degrading. And it didn't go well as my only escape was taken by my parents for failing so much. I spent the time fighting if I wanted to keep going honestly and I still am. But I digress. I managed to pull through and got myself into collage learning networking! But I'm having a hard time. It might be Because how I was raised but my memories have always negatively impacts my mood. Mostly because nothing was happy for me. Childhood was a train wreck. And I don't feel like anything is changing nothing happier is coming if I stay where I am. I'm hoping that if I leave and stay on my own. I could change for the better(my thoughts at least). So I'm asking what options do I have. Don't get the wrong idea. I love my parents with all my heart even though Ive been treated this way. I don't have a single hate in me. Nor anger. I prefer not to get angry at anyone. I feel bad for making someone mad or making them worry. Though Ive been made to worry alot. Haha. Ironic.

Anyway, if you skipped the text above. I just want to have some opinions and options from people. I'm not directly interacting with people so I can be as brave as I want. Anyway. How do I deal with this. I know if I don't do something it will affect me dearly. And I don't want that. I want to hope that I still have a chance. I want to live, I want to be able to not be sad from my memories. Be happier at least. What do I do. Should I seek therapy? I don't have a personal doctor so I need money and because of lockdowns I can't work. Or better yet. my parents wouldn't let me. I'm rather limited but I'll see the options and weigh it.",mentalhealth,2021-01-24 15:56:28

Finally I met a very kind, decent man and fell in love. I trusted him fully but was damaged from my past. I understood why he left me, but what hurt me the most was that he bad mouthed me to strangers even years later. He told people, including coworkers, very personal things about me and my family.

It’s been devastating for me and something that I still struggle with. It had been hard enough to get over him, let alone deal with his anger and gossip.

I’d like to move on into another relationship. I’ve been dating, but have had experiences where men have slept with me then ghosted me etc.

&amp;#x200B;

I always was the type of guy that kept to himself and never really interacted with anyone unless the other person started the conversation. I didn't saw a problem with that until I went to Highschool (It's called Gymnasium in german so I don't know if it's the correct word for it) and started to make some friends, mainly girls. I think I got along well enough with them to call them friends. Although we only ever met during the breaks at school and rarely outside of school we got along well.

&amp;#x200B;

Fast forward a couple of years and I finish school. Now out of the maybe 5 or 6 friends I had, only one kept in touch with me but it somehow got reduced to only texting over Whatsapp. After some time she suggested that maybe we could start playing games together. Since she knew I wasn't good with people her thought was that maybe after getting comfortable with actually talking to her she could start introducing me to her friends. I liked the idea that I could get out of my shell and become an extroverted person over time. And things went well, for the most part, I got comfortable with her and her friends so much so that I actually did trips with them, had my first actual party with alcohol and all that stuff. Obviously, there were some hiccups along the way where I fell back into my old self-isolating habit for a week or so but they were understanding and helped me get back on track.

&amp;#x200B;

Then after roughly 8 years of fun, we went on a trip to a local pond and went for a swim over the weekend. Unfortunately, I got a really bad sunburn and couldn't go with them the next day. This somehow escalated into a pretty intense argument because they thought I was just trying to come with an excuse because I didn't want to go with them the next day. This happened during a time where I was falling back into a self-isolating habit so their concerns weren't completely unjustified. This resulted in losing the last few friends I had left and I think it didn't help my mental health.

&amp;#x200B;

In the beginning, I didn't exactly felt depressed but over time I noticed that everything in my world seemed so pointless. I didn't felt suicidal I just had no real drive anymore to do anything except eat, sleep and work. Everything started to feel like I was stuck in some sort of colorless world. The only times I actually laughed in the last months was when I watched some anime. 

&amp;#x200B;

So now I'm sitting here in my room approaching my 21 years on this earth and I have nobody except my family to keep me company and even that will come to an end sometime. At the moment I really don't know if I want friends or if I even could talk to random strangers on the street to attempt to get some new friends because I haven't talked to anyone in the last few months. What I am trying to say is, I guess, that I am at the same time tired of being alone but also too scared of meeting new people.

&amp;#x200B;

I really didn't have a bad life until now but I'm scared of it only going downhill from here. I don't want to be alone all the time I just want to have some small semblance of a normal life. I don't even plan on getting a girlfriend anymore since I'm so introverted at the moment and not particularly a good-looking guy. 

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know if writing down my first-world problems will help me. Maybe I'm just wasting my time writing all this I really don't know. But maybe this will give me the energy to push through all this and maybe I can look back at this in 10 years and say that I moved on from this pathetic life onto a better more colorful life.",mentalhealth,2021-01-24 16:20:23

I am currently in the process of applying to graduate programs to do a masters program in my field. As part of all these applications, I have to write out a personal statement or statement of intent. It's basically an essay about why you want to do a masters program, and why you think you are the best candidate for the program. 

Now I'm a pretty good writer. I usually don't have an issue with getting my thoughts onto a page, and communicating my ideas. However, for my grad school applications, I just can't get my brain to work. Every time I try to write, my head goes blank and there are just no words. 

I don't know why this is happening, and I've never had this issue before. I really want to go to grad school, as I love research, and having a higher degree will give me more job opportunities. I also really want to have the experience of moving out and living on my own. 

The reason I think this might be self-sabotage is because from September/December 2020, I had a pretty bad mental health episode. I basically had zero motivation to do anything and lost all my confidence. However, I don't really understand how this could still be affecting me. In January I decided I needed to be a different person, so I started exercising every day, got a bullet journal and started doing guided meditation. I'm doing all the right things to manage my mental health, so I don't understand why I can't see myself in a positive light to do my application. 

I'm just...really confused at this point. I don't know what to do, or why I'm doing this to myself.

Hey guys. I'm not sure how many here are into the animation/gaming/streaming scene here but I figured I would just express some stuff here. Growing up with Autism and having an interest in art and special interests in things like anime, games, certain series (Pokemon, Yu-Gi-Oh, Beyblade, Klonoa, Sonic, etc), animation/cartoons, visual storytelling, etc. led to many challenges growing up in school, including constant bullying and feelings of nonexistent self-worth. It often felt like I was the kid everyone hated and some went out of their way to express that. It also wasn't easy being that kid and also going through trauma, and very difficult family life and abuse, including a divorce.

It was very difficult, but I did not let it stop me (otherwise I wouldn't be here saying this).

Around high school-ish time, I started doing something I had a passion for for a while, which was doing YouTube videos and streams, many about that topic matter. And as most content creators do, I evolved my content and made it the best I could all with a sense of style and high-energy humor combined with visual effects, especially in the videos and animations I made. 


Then after a while... like say, some years ago more trauma happened in my living circumstance. A lot of it gave me the worthless feelings all over again and caused me to not spend any time at all on content creating, and while it's been over for well over a year, I am still healing from it all. Also, a lot of my friendships at the time became toxic and in cause of it, I deleted my YouTube and Twitch and DeviantArt and Insta and other social medias despite the hundreds of subscribers and followers (which did stay stagnant/drop during my period of low creation). 

Last year near the end of last year, I really wanted to bring friends together and do a combination of a anime/gaming awards show I love doing combined with a art showcase of the creative endeavors my friends have created and put them for all to see in streaming. Of course though... the event did not go through as there was some serious drama in my friend group that was my audience and would not have been a good idea to create then despite how much I wanted to make some people (including myself) happy for 2020. 
It's especially not easy when after the fact I saw that people on YouTube and Twitch managed to create something that made a lot of people happy, things I always wanted to do as well such as review every season of Pokemon in-depth and with collaborators, or continue a story for an obscure game series through fancomic. These people also have millions of subscribers and they're my age or even younger, like 18 while I am 23. Absolutely nothing against those videos of course, they did great! Just I feel like there's no need for what I do and I am questioning if I am even talented at all or even make anyone happy. I just feel very depressed out of it and I feel very discouraged to do this stuff even now yet I still seriously want to. What should I do? Do I even have talent? Even when I did have subs I didn't have as many as, say Mark or Pewds. I don't even know how I should feel. I just feel empty. 


Any sort of words or advice or experience or anything would be appreciated.

So, I've generally been sheltered all my life, stunting the possibilities of me having any kind of meaningful friendship before the age of 10.

That also meant she had full control over my interests. I was jealous of all the kids at the schools we past by (usually around the ages of 13-16) and later, the older kids at my former school.

Generally, most of the kids at that age back then made stuff like robots, practiced engineering, played sports, etc. They didn't even have to be schoolchildren, it could be anyone who works at IT in Novi Sad or Poland or whatever. 

My parents generally wanted me to speedrun life until I reach puberty to be like them, but for what?

A good chunk of my friends are like this and I feel guilty around them. I feel like shouldn't be with them, they're better than me in almost every way, they didn't go through the same past as me. They're doing literally everything I wanted to do at 6 years old. They're almost like my idol.

I’ve been in a very supportive and loving relationship for almost two years now, but find myself still falling back into Stockholm syndrome type tendencies and it’s pushing my partner to a point where he’s almost had enough. For example, while out and about today he asked me where I would like to eat and I had the hardest time answering him because I didn’t want it to be inconvenient. I have an extremely hard time making decisions without his input because I want to make sure my decision is okay with him. He’s assured me time and time again that if I come up with a decision that he doesn’t like or agree with it’s not the end of the world whatsoever and that we would instead have a conversation about it and come up with a better idea together. Is there any kind of reading material about overcoming the long term mental affects of Stockholm syndrome AFTER the fact since all of my previous relationships have centered around narcissists and I literally know nothing different and it’s affecting the only healthy relationship I have EVER had.",mentalhealth,2021-01-24 17:08:08

I dropped out of school, quit my shitty job, and stopped taking specific medicine because it wasn't working on me. I felt numb... not sad or even mad... just empty. I decided on that day that I needed to get help and being stuck at home wasn't going to help anything so I called my mom and told her the news and she was like ""Wait until I get home and we'll talk about it.""

I agreed, but my decision was already made. I packed my things, called my grandma, and texted everyone I knew that I was going in. My toxic ex-friend was rude, my good best friend was understanding, my brother was mixed and my sister found out later I checked in. When my mom came home there was no convincing me and I was ready to check in. We left at 7pm and went to this really fancy hospital... let's call it TS, TS was the best facility I could find especially since my first stay in a ward wasn't great so I picked the best one.

My mom tried to be supportive but kept complaining about missing her shows and how this never happened to her other kids, when she said I had her leave while waiting for the exam doctor. I know my mom means well and she was somewhat supportive while I was in the hospital, but it didn't feel like she was all there for me, you know what I mean?

Anyway, Tuesday was my official first day in treatment and I met a lot of nice people being there and one girl who, bless her heart, was struggling with severe bipolar and so it made her hyper, angry and annoying. Again she meant well, but it was a lot to take in... like a lot. Not a lot of people liked her, I talked to her a lot of times and she seems again like she means well. We all do mean well in that hospital. One girl told me I didn't have bipolar because I didn't experience mania anymore (I have in the past and recently before I got back on lithium to the point I felt like I was having a heart attack) and she basically all but implied I was doing it for attention. Yeah, my crying fits, tantrums, freakouts, panic attacks, and suicide attempts were ALL for attention!

Groups were nice, but I took lots of naps while in there so I skipped a few, but for the one, I went to I learned about A.C.C.E.P.T.S., time management, smart goals, gratitudes, etc. I'm happy for what I learned and I'm still trying to apply them to my life, it's hard, but it's a learning experience and one I'm glad to try and do. 

When my brother found out he gave me terrible advice and said using hardcore drugs and smoking weed would ""cure"" my bipolar 2. So yeah, might need to talk to him less, but my sister was actually supportive and my grandma... wow she was like there for me and helped me out all the way through my treatment, I talked to her every day and while some of her advice was the simple ""Trust Jesus"", but she told me a lot of information and advice that really helped me! I wish my mom could've been that supportive, again she was there for me as much as she could be, sent me money, and whatnot, but you know how a ""normal"" person will never understand the mental instability of a person? That's my mom. I'm not saying everyone is like that, but my mom was and doesn't fully understand the fact I have bipolar 2 (or if not that something) and I need help. 

My stay at TS was calm and wild at the same time. Finally, got to watch deadpool 2 and met some new friends, but would I ever want to go back there? No! And I'm going to do everything outside of those walls to feel better and find my purpose in the world. I can do this. I've got it in me and may even blog here to help me cope.

But as for right now I'm jobless, not going to school, tiktok videos to make, and have over 50 books to read in the next few months. Oh, and money from my taxes to hold me over until next year as long as I budget it. Wish me luck on my journey guys. I'm gonna need it.",mentalhealth,2021-01-24 17:21:11

It might be a sum of many things:

--
Ive been doing music production / songwriting full time in my country for several years and prior to that, i made music passionately as a hobby.
Gradually, ive lost my interest in it and it's scary! It's been this way for a year i'd say. Right now I dont look forward going to work, i dont feel inspired listening to music, my accomplishments dont feel like much and even though i'm pretty succesful, i'm also a bit indifferent. I thought this was going to be my life career but it doesnt feel that way anymore.. It feels i've realised it suddenly and it disappoints me. 
Sometimes I have no idea whether it's because i dont genuinely enjoy my work ( or at least not doing it full time ) and want to do something else or whether it's me being depressed or burnt out.
All i know is after christmas, i just collapsed, started to feel exhausted, sleepless and depressed. 

During these past months ive also moved to a new apartment, my family has an internal crisis, the whole corona thing is stressing me out, i worked long days with almost no vacations etc...

All i know is, i want to be on vacation as long as i can at the moment to avoid going back to work..

I've looked into alternative fields and though about maybe keeping music as a hobby like i used to. Thinking about a fresh start in some other field feels kind of good even though i dont know exactly what i should do. 
And also, at this age, i'm starting to think about a stable job more so that i can slowly start to entertain the idea of a partner / family and so on... something i cannot do in the music field. As long as it's at least an ""ok"" job, i think i'm going to be satisfied and find joy in other things in my life.
--

So i started my SSRI meds again and see a therapist now and then. I'm also on sick leave until end of the month. I've slept better in general but still feel depressed and unmotivated. I thought i was ready to try slowly getting back to work but now im wondering whether i should stay home on sick leave or just try to do stuff and not isolate myself too much.

and today i figured out it could be Psychosis. of course i read about it in the past, but it include hallucinations and hearing voices which didn't happen to me. but i'm gonna make it easier and describe what i have, and hopefully someone will help.

i can simply say, the way i think is different. it's like having schizophrenia but also act like someone who doesn't have any mental issues. it just happens inside my head, i'm very calm and quiet person, and very realistic, maybe more than other people.

for example, when i see paintings by artists who were mentally ill, i find it normal and not too weird, i actually think nothing is weird in this world. and also, even i'm not an artist, i can simply paint something that other artists can't do, and make weird more than anything you can think of. my imagination has no limit. i compared myself to other people for years, to writers, poets, painters, but it's not only about art and creativity, it affect me in everything i do in daily life, every single thought or move my brain can't process it normally like other people. i feel confused, and have to think about everything i did so i can continue. most of this stuff i used to understand how it happens, and i try to keep calm and not respond. but if i did, i still feel my brain is overheating, like a fire inside me, and i can't think correctly about anything.

as it's described for people with Psychosis that they can't think clearly, that's exactly me. i think if i have Psychosis, then AvPD made it affect me differently and i became the way i am today. i'm very aware of how i think, and how i react to everything, doesn't matter how weird it is. i think the correct term for it is metacogntion. but in my case, it's more complicated than that.

i'm 26 m ,i always had AvPD, mybe it wasn't complicated like when i grew up, but it was always there. and the other things started in my teenage years, i was 14 when everything became harder.

my English sucks, and i wish i could explain more, but i guess you got what i'm trying to describe.

How do I get her to seek help?,"Ever since gradating high school and entering college and the workforce (her four year course is taking 7+ years because she can only mentally manage one class at a time while working) she has made everyone's life a living hell. She goes through brief periods of time where she is fine (they are almost always when she is not in school) or her stress-outbursts are only happen 1-2 times a month (tolerable) Then, she will go through periods when on a daily basis for months on end she has complete breakdowns (like nearly everyday). She acts incredibly rude to everyone, blaming us for everything, and will scream and cry and generally act like a toddler. She can jump from calm to screaming out of nowhere. We either have to coddle her or, if we , say, mention that she is being really rude, she will scream (at the top of her lungs) then run up stairs to cry, abandoning the work she was so stressed about finishing.  Being nice and comforting often doesn't work because she gets so argumentative and pessimistic that no matter what we say it's wrong. We try to comfort her? Wrong. We ignore her? Wrong. We don't take her crap? Obviously wrong but we have been putting up with this for so long. I have literally seen her get down on her knees and bang on the floor. I have seen her punch herself. I have 8 years of examples. She will be turning 26 soon.

I have tried to explain to her that i want to see her get some help from a counsellor that specializes in stress management. She is insanely terrible at stress management. (Her best form of stress management is venting for hours on end to anyone who will listen. Her work and school dominate every conversation we have). She is more receptive to the idea than she used to be but i still don't know how to get her to seek help. I have a long history of sever mental illness and I was more than happy to get myself help so it's really hard for me to understand why she is so hesitant. Obviously, she is not mentally ill, so there is a huge difference. I can only think the issue is that she has not acknowledged she has a problem (I mean, she kind of does sometimes when she apologizes to us after an outburst)

And since I messed up very past lockdown by not doing any of my schoolwork because I procrastinated, I put 101% effort into doing everything this time. I’m especially stressed because the lockdown was said to be three weeks long and already got extended during the first or second week. I feel like this lockdown will last forever. So I have to be the best and most productive version of myself. 

Things are going well, I thought. But my mental health is suffering a lot. I keep forgetting stuff. Today I took a beautiful refreshing walk with my family. And I forgot about it. Just a few hours later. I often can’t remember what I did the other day or in the morning. This is not normal at this point. 

Another thing that really suffers because of this is my relationship. I just had to tell my boyfriend that lately all I can think about is school. I’m a very honest person, I feel like I should tell him. I also told him that this means lately I’m not thinking of him as much. And he said this hurt, but he understands. I just want him to break up with me. When I’m stressed like this, I’m the worst girlfriend. Because in this kinds of situations, romance is the last thing I can think of. I even thought of telling him that we might be better off taking a break until the lockdown ends, but I don’t want to let him go. He’s the first person that means something to me that I have a relationship with. If he left, my world would end. 

The lockdown only lasted two weeks yet but it felt like months - or years. And it might get extended until April. I feel like if that’s the case, I’ll have forgotten about who I am and who I used to be. I might have to do some sort of anti stress therapy, because this is not healthy at all. I’m stressed to a point where life feels not worth living at all, although I shouldn’t feel stressed. I have such a bad fear of messing up, I can’t take any of this at all.

Tldr: My boyfriend started being mean and intolerant of my existence yesterday while blaming it on a different person that exists within him I wasn't aware of. I'm worried about his mental health and unsure of how I should address this change.",mentalhealth,2021-01-24 18:26:01

I guess i want answers, even though labels are supposed to be bad and i can’t get a diagnosis here, i want to know what’s wrong with me so then maybe i can fix it. Is that bad? I’m told i was always a shy kid and i remember being VERY anxious at parties and things when i was as young as 5/6 years old, so i’m not sure if that’s when my life started going downhill or if that’s normal. It didn’t get worse until i was around 12, i think that’s when i noticed that people judge you and will be mean for no reason... so i got even more anxious and ended up pretty depressed. I was a good student, i did my work perfectly and never missed a day up until i started feeling that way. I wanted to die, and i came close to doing it. I tried to not speak to anyone i didn’t know incase they bullied me, i sat silent in class and hoped no one noticed me, i ended up missing a huge chunk of secondary school because i hated it so much i would have panic attacks on my way there and run home. This was a continuous feeling until i was maybe 15, at this point it was an on and off thing. I would be energetic and fine for months, before falling into a few months long episode of depression. I was really getting paranoid , thinking everyone was looking at me and wanted to ruin my life. This on and off feeling carried on for a while until now. I’m 19 this year, and i feel different. This is my current situation:

The feeling of depression doesn’t come and go, it doesn’t feel like it’s constant either.. but i’m not happy. I don’t care anymore. It feels like i’m stuck in this constant loop, i wake up, i do my uni work, i make food, i sleep. It feels so pointless. I’m not sad about it, i’m not happy about it. Idk how to explain it i just feel nothing, i have no opinion towards anything anymore. If i failed i wouldn’t care, if i passed i wouldn’t care. I wouldn’t seek out my own death, but if someone killed me right now i wouldn’t complain. I say i feel nothing but at the same time my paranoia seems worse and it bothers me a little. I pushed all my friends away, idk why, i guess i don’t trust them because why would someone be friends with me? One person stayed and she won’t leave me no matter what i do, and i guess you could say she’s a real friend. I appreciate her so much for putting up with me, but it also seems so suspicious, like i feel as if she’s doing this for a reason. It makes me hurt her feelings when i know she doesn’t deserve it. I’m a bad person. I want to change and be normal but i don’t know how, Ive told my mum about how i feel several times but she insists it’s normal and that’s everyone wants to die sometimes. It confuses me, like is this really normal? I get irritated very easily, i snap over nothing. I get so angry and do things, then when i’ve cooled down i don’t know what i did. This is something i also did as i kid and i didn’t know until my younger sister mentioned it traumatised her when she was younger. She told me one time i was so upset and frustrated i sat on the stairs shouting, hitting myself and drawing all over myself with a marker. My parents were freaking out and recording me saying they’re going to show it to a doctor but i guess they never did. She mentioned i had outbursts like this often, but i have no memory of it happening at all and it scares me (i was around 12/13 when this happened so surely i should remember it). Is this simply stress induced memory loss or something more complex? There are minor instances of this that happen pretty often when i’m not upset or anything, like my friends and parents say they’ve told me something and i have no recollection of them telling me anything. It could be totally unrelated though, maybe i just have an awful memory. I’m trying to feel better, by making a schedule and things. But the last schedules i tried have made me more depressed because i can’t stand doing the same thing everyday. Even if i feel better this time how do i stop these outbursts i have little to no memory of. It makes me feel so confused and sad when people are always telling me like no this is what happened and that is what happened. It hurts my feeling so much when i remember something happening one way and i’m told i’m “making things up”. I don’t know what’s true and what isn’t.

I’m sure i’ve missed a lot of things, it’s very rushed and i haven’t read it back because i’m a bit of a disaster of a person lmao but i’m hoping maybe someone knows how to explain this or if one person can relate it would make me feel a lot less confused and alone. 

I don’t know where to seek help and i supposed that’s why i’m here, i’ve tried counselling several times but it wasn’t effective and i was never directed anywhere else afterwards. I’m from the north east of england if anyone can recommend help around this area i would be grateful.",mentalhealth,2021-01-24 18:26:53

I don’t realize I’m doing it until someone checks up on me or calls me out for it.

I’ve gotten much better about understanding what I’m doing is not of any ill-intention and I no long have suicidal ideations. I used to obsess to the point I would tell myself that I no longer deserve to life because I only hurt the ones I love. Those intrusive thoughts have left me, but still have a hard time forgiving myself for the mistakes I’ve made in the past. 

I’ve lost all of my friends but one because of my behavior. I always apologize for it and all of them are so kind and forgive me and I convince myself that I don’t need to be anywhere near them anymore. And I only think the one friend I have left really doesn’t want to be around, she’s only playing nice because we married into the same family. She’s told me a million times that she knows my behavior isn’t malicious and she forgives me for pushing her away. I don’t believe her anymore. The last mistake I made was on December 6th and I still think about it multiple times every day. I’m telling myself that I want friends and I want to socialize but there’s no use in it because I’ll just ghost them until it’s too late and that’s awful. I’ve grown so much because I’m finally close and open with family, but now I feel as if I’ve hit a road block.

Does anybody have any useful, healthy ways of learning self-forgiveness? Do you know successful ways with dealing with obsessive thoughts and rumination?",mentalhealth,2021-01-24 18:51:22

The other day I shared a picture of my pup to a fb group and one of the first responses was “looks like the dog under my tires the other day.” Extremely unnecessary, disturbing,  and prompted me to take my photo down. 

Im seeing some unsavory remarks on some of the more private “support groups” I’m a part of. Even “dead” threads from months/years ago. I’m getting hit with all sorts of strange and unpleasant notifs. After being on the internet for 15 years I can tell you this is WAY more than the norm. 

There’s also the interaction where people ask me for incessant detail for something deep/personal just to turn hostile and snippy at the end. Or abandon thread. Usually these interactions would be positive. I feel like I’m being grilled now for the sake of humiliation or exposure. I fell for it twice, but on second thought I’m going to pull those comments. 

I’m going to pull my profiles and deactivate for a few months. 

6 years ago, I had a badly depressed break and lost my ability to function for a while. I turned to the internet (my usual forums) for support and the more I reached out the more bullied I got. It started with some bans and then people trying to outright deliberately trigger my sexual assault memories and calling me homo slurs. I was on those forums for years but something changed abruptly. I’m feeling that same kind of energy. I’m not having a “break” but right now I’m feeling a little on edge and permanently in discomfort and anxiety. 

My theory is that you can be targeted by trolls via the same milieus that advertisers target you. I know there’s a lot of uprisings in Russia in the past 72 hours, when I received the bulk of these comments. I hate to sound like a conspiracy theorist but I’m really afraid of Russia and algorithms manipulating my deepest feelings. I feel like my concern of being cornered and bullied is mild compared to what Qanon managed to convince millions of people. 

I’ll just never forget how destructive a concerted effort of Machiavellian souls can be in a shroud of anonymity. I don’t want to learn that lesson again.

It really hurts because the internet is usually my place of comfort and happiness. I don’t have a lot of IRL friends. God I feel like this is a huge mistake posting this.

To begin with I want to apologise if there is some misspelling, I know English but it's not my first language.

Okey to be honest, I'm not sure how to explain this but lately I'm in this constant fear of death, mostly because of some undetected illness. I am a healthy teenager, I only suffer of anxiety and depression but I am doing well because of therapy and medication. I have no physical condition yet I am in constant fear of something haooenin to me.

For example, some days ago I had low pressure because of the weather (it's summer where I live) and I couldn't stop worrying about it, I thought I was having a stroke. Another even weirder example, yesterday after brushing my teeth I had a funny/weird taste in my mouth and my mind wouldn't stop thinking if I had some infection or a cancer in my mouth or if I had accidentally consumed some toxic cleaning product (I know it doesn't make sense, that's my problem!)

I have this paranoia all the time and it's always related to some health condition. I try to calm myself down but I can't, my mind is faster than me and it starts thinking about illnesses, infections, etc. It's pretty exhausting. I've always been overdramatic but at this point this is overwhelming.

Just a few minutes ago a situation transpired with my parents and I don’t really know how to perceive it. Due to being autistic I don’t always understand certain social implications and cues, so I have trouble seeing where the areas I may have been rude were in this situation.

My parents had made fresh wraps for dinner and we were all standing at the counter to make them. My dad is to my left, and then my mom comes to my right and starts reaching over to grab from the bowls we are all using to make our wraps. I get claustrophobic, so I take a step back. My mom and dad suddenly start rolling their eyes and holding their head and shouting. 

I start to panic and say “what did I do, I don’t understand.” They start yelling more and more so I try to calm my voice down; they tell me i’m escalating the situation and start storming out of the room.

I start to have a full on meltdown. They yell at me (fairly because I am shouting and pacing in circles at this point) and tell me to “you’re not calm” “you’re acting weird” and eventually leave for a five minute break. 

I won’t go into detail here because I don’t want to trigger anyone, but it did trigger my self harm habits, which i’m not proud of.

We go back down and they are talking like nothing happened; i’m still a little shaken but hungry. We sit down at the table and i’m not making eye contact and talking in what I remember to be a quiet and probably timid sounding voice; my mom says to me “we talk normally at this table”; I just go quiet.

After dinner my mom comes up and tells me I overreacted when my dad had (earlier but not mentioned) been flapping his arms when I approached the food and I got scared and cowered away. My mom tells me he wasn’t going to hurt me and I shouldn’t have reacted in a scared manner. However for some reason in the situation it felt like he was going to hit me. 

My father doesn’t hit me, he mainly yells. However he did only once and to be honest that memory hasn’t left my mind since.

Anxiety is a beast and i have it since god knows when  childhood i think, never went to a doctor because i just can't tell my parents. The kind of anxiety which causes diarrhea, bad stomach all the time, back pain, sweaty palms, anger bursts, delusions i think ( cause whenever someone passes by me or is sitting behind me i feel like they are laughing at me whether in public or my college) so yeah that too but at the same time i'm preety smart and sober can be extremely confident, brave at times but not all time. 

College has started after a few days off cause of covid, works piling up n i just can't do anything when it comes to studying my brain just shuts down. Because of my unruly sleeping patern i was missing online classes which caused me a tremendous amount of stress cause if that kept up i'd get suspended or worse fail. 
So one day i discovered hydrylin which was precribed for my brother, took two spoons in my panicked state and started feeling drowsy. I woke up the other day immediatly and on time active but after a few hours my mood was questionable to say the least i felt sad, dazed. Not excited about the things that i used to be crazy about. Just blank.
I thought that was cause of the medicine so i avoided it
But now i have a sore throat since some days also absent from college, the minute i step into that building the lectures after lectures for long hours overwhelm me plus my shitty sleep schedule. The stress of studying and being behind everyone causes my stomach to twist whenever i'm heading out. No taking deep breaths does Not help nor does meditation cause i can't focus on shit so i've decided to start taking a little cough syrup before starting my day to help me cause at this point my exams are about to start in 2 months and i haven't done shit. Was just worried about any side effects or whatever",mentalhealth,2021-01-24 20:03:14

However today I decided what if i tried to induce a sense of euphoria? And get really happy. And it worked. I forced myself to get really really happy and I started smiling for like an hour. I was really energetic and jittery/motivated, and then i went to a neutral state.

The induced state lasted about an hour.

This shouldn’t be possible for a depressed person, a person is not “depressed” if they can force themselves to be like that for such an extended period. The euphoria was also not naturally occurring/ part of another illness as it had never happened before and I made myself do it.

I don’t understand why my mood is like this, I thought I had some sort of depression but this makes me doubt that. It just doesn’t make sense. Am I faking depression?

At that point I look out the window and right below me, with its front end in my basement, is a Cadillac with a visibly drunk driver at the wheel. He got out and tried running, but my roommate caught him and held him until the police arrived and they put him in the car. 

Code Enforcement showed up after the tow company pulled the Cadillac out of my foundation and declared the property condemned for human occupancy and shut the gas off to discourage us from remaining in the home. The plates on the vehicle were swapped, the driver was uninsured, my landlord doesn’t have a policy on the property, and we don’t have renters insurance.

She has been through a lot in her life, and she is the strongest person I know.

She has been working as a nurse overseas for atleast 20 years. She has been through shit and hell, she has been abused, and even betrayed by her own family members. She endured all of those to give me a better life than what she had.

Before we moved here to Virginia less than two years ago, my grandpa (her dad) was diagnosed with cancer, and she paid for all of his treatments. When we got here, he died anyway, and that was the first time I’ve witnessed my mom break down so hard. 

She also discovered my dad has been cheating on her for years now. Again, she broke down, much harder this time.

Now she is very depressed. She would often talk about suicide, I’m sure she would’ve ended her life long ago, if it were not for me and my sister. She even admits to us that we are the only ones keeping her alive.
 She still works 6 times a week full time, and everytime she gets home I can see the sadness in her eyes so I just look away cuz it really brings me pain seeing her like this. She also starves herself, and barely talks to anyone. 

One thing that rlly breaks my heart is her stories from work. My mom is not very fluent in English and her coworkers get irritated at her for it. She told me her coworkers yell at her, and she feels so dumb. She feels so humiliated at work, she thinks people are talking behind her back. She has no friends there, and she tells me that she rlly don’t wanna work anymore, but she has too because we have to survive.

There’s a lot more I have to say, but it’s going to be so long. I’m crying as I write this story. I brings so much pain to see my mom like this. I want to help but I don’t know how...I feel mad at myself for not being a better daughter, everytime I think if my mom I instantly cry.

I have anxiety, so I’m very aware of how anxiety feels- when I’m thinking of going to sleep, my chest tightens and I can feel myself start to panic. Because I know I’ll probably dream and I worry what dream I’ll have. 

I know it sounds strange, it’s strange for me too. I don’t really know what to do about it. I don’t wake up or anything during the night so it doesn’t really make me tired, but I do tend to stay up later so I can put off sleeping.

Last year was tough missing out on over half a year of school, I came back for a couple of months only to have to do homeschooling again. So much has happened and I don't know what to do , so many lies, so many thoughts and so much disruption and I just don't know what to do.

It started with homeschooling and struggling to do any work or study, and I've been a good student my whole life. I used to be ""gifted"" but know I just feel washed up and at the bottom. I have been getting bad grades and I don't have the guts to tell my friends and family. I promised so much and I can't tell them I've failed. Every morning is a struggle, getting motivation to do the work or even look at what I have to do as I get so stressed and anxious about teachers saying something about missing homeworks. I feel I've dug a hole so deep I can't ever get out.

Then there was the strange time in my life where I figured out I might not be entirely straight a couple months back. Ive only told 2 trusted friends about it, both been supportive, but I feel like I'm lying to myself, and it's merely attention seeking. I try to repress it as much as possible as it will only make my anxiety worse.

And worst of all is how much I overthink what I say. I hate it. Every text needs to be perfect every interaction needs to be perfect and I feel like I can't take a joke anymore. I feel like I'm getting more out of touch every day with my friends as I can't tell the difference between their irony and them being serious.

I'm currently writing this at 2am unable to get asleep and I just had to say something, I think I desperately need help, and some of this might be hard to read as it might not be well written but I thank anyone who reads and gives advice. I'll read anything tomorrow morning so if I don't reply that's why. Thanks",mentalhealth,2021-01-24 21:17:43

I've been taking the Burprion for about 10 days (supposed to move up to 300mg next week). This has happened 2 times since, but this isn't the first time it's happened. It also happened when I accidentally got high on THC. I sometimes use CBD with microdoses of THC, this is a prescription and I only use it once every few months when I am having panic attacks. If I accidentally get too much THC I have similar spirals of suicidal fears.

I have a follow up with my psychiatrist in a couple of weeks. I'm just curious what other people think.

For so long I had been told to practice self care for my mental health, which always seemed to focus on doing not much of anything. Having a bubble bath, reading a book, etc.

However, she mentioned ‘environmental self care’ which I’d never heard of before. Doing small tasks around your home such as tidying your desk, reorganising a cupboard, cleaning the windows, etc. these contribute to your self care and positive mental health as you’re doing something to improve the way you feel about your environment. 

As someone who gets incredibly anxious and uncomfortable when practicing traditional self care as I feel like I’m being unproductive, and then further anxiety over how many ‘jobs’ I should be doing instead, this was a revelation. 

So I put on some music, went out in the sunshine, and weeded/watered the garden. Didn’t take too long, or too much physical effort, but I got to achieve something that had been on my mind and listen to my favourite music at the same time. Gave me a sense of accomplishment, and makes me happier about how the garden looks too.

In early December we moved into my grandma’s house. Before moving in, I kept telling my grandma all these worst case scenarios I was afraid of happening. She kept telling me it will be alright! Said that if she gets mad she’ll go to her corner, we go to ours calm down, then talk about it. Sounds good! Except that didn’t happen. She got angry with us on the daily for seemingly NO reason. I would have to ask her what’s wrong, how can I make it better, blah blah.

She moved into this old dump of a house, and she needed help with it. My fiancé worked his ass off to make her happy. Constantly lifting heavy boxes for her, dragging away rolls of heavy carpet, screwing in new curtains for her on all her windows, caulking her bathtub, and the like. She was being very moody one day, so I assumed she would probably appreciate it if I cleaned out her living room and set up her TV and chairs. Cleared it out of more boxes and rolled up heavy rugs (the entire time she sat nearby and watched me work, and no, she isn’t any form of handicapped), moved this GIGANTIC fake fireplace that weighed a ton, got her TV all set up, and did this make her happy? NO. The next day she was being mean and nasty, telling us we hadn’t done enough. When I mentioned that I was sore, she snapped, “from what?! Moving things?!? Ooooooo! I’m nearly 72 years old and I-“ at that point I unbuckled my seat belt and hopped out of her car! As I walked away she followed me and was screaming at me like a CRAZY PERSON. I ran home and tried to call and talk to my mom, but I couldn’t stop screaming my words! I started throwing things, punched the wall, and then I started SCREAMING at the top of my lungs, over and over until my stomach cramped. Grandma came in and wiped my tears, saying everything is okay. Tried to say later she wasn’t even mad, and she was only screaming to yell over the radio (the radio wasn’t even on, and what the fuck ever).

Even though I knew she was full of it, I tried to make things better. Thought that if I did something EVERY DAY that that would make her happy. If I asked her every day how she was doing, maybe she would appreciate that. Obviously, didn’t work. I couldn’t do a DAMN THING for myself without feeling guilty!! Couldn’t read on my phone, talk on the phone, play a video game, I couldn’t even SLEEP without feeling guilty! I became sleep deprived, my panic disorder (which before was manageable) was out of control and I couldn’t manage it, and lastly, I was constantly jumping I would constantly feel like I could hear grandma coming.

Now to recent events. We have two cats. Both boys, neutered, got their shots. They’re still pretty young and love to tussle and climb things. My cats were one of the things I warned her about. She insisted it was fine to bring them! That she LOVES animals! She didn’t tell us before we moved in that our bedroom has NO DOOR. Otherwise I would not have been keen on the idea of bringing my cats. For a door we have a blanket hanging, and a baby gate (mostly to keep her dog out). We have tried stacking things against the blanket/gate to trap them in. It didn’t work! I tried buying these melatonin cat treats to hopefully make them sleep at night. NOPE. Nap for a few hours, then up and at it again. Yesterday my grandma became angry because our cat’s keep getting into her cats food/litter box. I asked her if she wanted the food replaced, or for me to clean the litter box for her. She shrieked “NO” at me. I tried to explain to her that I don’t know what to do, I don’t have a door! Tried to tell her all the ways I tried to keep them in at night. I thought I made her see reason and went to sit with my fiancé and discuss what happened. When suddenly she busts into our bedroom brandishing an empty cat bowl and screams, “do something about your cats or I will!!” My fiancé lost it and started yelling at her, she got in his face and yelled back that we can pack our shit and get out. At this point I started screaming at her that she was ungrateful and called her all kinds of nasty names. I then grabbed a knife and threatened to slit my wrists. She made me put the knife back and I slammed it down.

We went to our room and tried to calm down (didn’t really work because I ripped out chunks of my hair). I talked to a friend for a few hours and she advised me to apologize and make nice. So I tried to... she was on the phone and she immediately started screaming at me to go away. I tried to say I wanted to apologize and she said she didn’t give a fuck. Then she put her phone call on speaker phone, and it was my uncle who’s in prison. He said, “MistyCrows. I love you. But if you guys ever do that again, I’m going to send my buddies to beat you both within an inch of your life.” My grandma looked so PROUD.

I went to my room and tried to call anyone I could... I started ripping out chunks of my hair and couldn’t stop crying! Hours and hours of constant crying!!! I know I should call the warden and let them know what my uncle said on a recorded phone call, but what if he DOES have friends that will come over here?! What if calling the warden is a bad thing?! I don’t know!!

Around 2 in the morning I finally called the crisis line, and told them what had happened and how badly I want to die. Told them about ripping out my hair, how I want to slit my wrists and how easy it would be to get a knife from the kitchen and how sharp they are. So they sent some deputies over to do a wellness check on both my fiancé and I... they were really nice, and helped me calm down. I promised not to hurt myself. But I still feel so depressed.

We’re going to have to move back in with my fiancé’s parents. It wasn’t a good situation there either, though, and they’re already saying “there’s going to be some changes.” So I don’t feel great about this.

FYI: we are on HUD housing lists and have been for over two years now. We also applied for a housing voucher the very moment they started the list. A friend recently let me know that there’s a ton of work from home options now since the pandemic, and I am interested in finding part time work doing that, but if I’m moving soon then I think I should wait until I’m situated.

My family keeps just getting crazier, let me explain. Here is my very interesting personal story that is almost hard to believe. So to start off, my parents are eastern european and do not believe in depression and other mental issues. And so I cannot really get help because of my mother. After my parent's divorce in elementary school I fell into a major depression that I still have not gotten out of. I was both, and still am, both of my parent's therapist, even when I was only 9, they came to be with their financial issues and lawyer issues all because I was the oldest child. ""Your mother doesn't love me anymore."" My dad cheated on my mom for 10 consecutive years with multiple people and she simply wanted a family. Soon after the divorce, my mother started dating my dads best friend. That turned out terribly because my Dad obviously didn't like that. So around 2013 they were dating seriously for around the next 4 years. I have known him ever since I was literally born, Vlad, a very close family friend. During their relationship, we went to Germany one time and after eating out, we decided to go back to the apartment with the family we were staying with. We had 2 cars, it was a mom and dad and child, me, my sister, my mom and Vlad. My sister decided to go with the other family because the cars are small. I went with my mom and as soon as I stepped in the car, (around 11 pm) Vlad started yelling at me about how fucking narcissistic I am and how much I hate and neglect my sister, all while swerving through small, car filled roads. I had never been so scared in my life. I simply made the logical decision, to go where there is more room. This went on for a good 5 minutes in the dark German night before my mom finally told him to stop. That was the first time I realized he was crazy. He accused my mother of cheating on him around 2 years in, and kept making up these insane dilemas. He put a tracker we didn't know of under her car, tracked her cell phone calls and called and texted constantly. Did I mention they were engaged? Yea. My mom finally broke up with him and there were 2 or 3 occasions in which he continued following us home at literally 2 in the morning and would come at 4 am to knock on the door, drunk to speak to my mother. It was horrible. Simultaneously my father was getting very serious with a 28 year old woman that he eventually married a couple of years ago. She was a bartender and was very nice at first. then she turned into an alcoholic, drank 4/5 moscow mules when we went out, every time. That continued getting worse and Jan 2020 they broke up. My dad picked me up from school one time and told me that she is addicted to coke and wouldn't let him help her. She said she was too controlling and they are currently in the process of finalizing divorce. I have since moved in with my mom into her new boyfriends house. He is nice but I literally feel like I can't take my mother anymore. I cannot speak to her I can't even stand, I feel depressed around her and I do feel bad.

However, I’ve started to find friends to spend time with, and I don’t think they do these things. I want to know if there’s something wrong with me, and more importantly, if I can do anything about it. I’m using my other account for privacy reasons, so please ignore my username.

I like to put things in my mouth. Hands, my debit card, dice… anything really. For as long as I can remember.

I have blinking patterns, nodding patterns, sometimes humming patterns. Also for as long as I can remember.

I like to rub off my skin and eat it, chew my fingertips, and pop my pimples and blackheads, eating what comes out. This started when I was 15 and stressed out with school. I quit for a few months when I was 16, which felt physically \*painful\*, but I did it. However, when the COVID pandemic struck, it slithered back again. I’ve been doing it again for almost a year now.

I talk to myself a lot, imagining that I’m having conversations with people I know and like. It started when I had a family crisis at 14 and had no one to talk to, now it’s a habit I can’t stop.

Some medical info:

I was diagnosed with depression and anxiety at 12, and my psychologist also told me that I have OCD symptoms. I’ve been tested for both ADHD and autism, of which I have neither. However, I was told that I have executive dysfunction (great at metacognition, though!). During those assessments, I never displayed the behaviours I’ve listed above, because I can put them off for a few hours. I don’t have much access to those services anymore. Unless my doctors noticed because I did them accidentally, they never knew about these behaviours.

I don’t have a history of abuse. The only big problem in my childhood was that I felt like I had to be an adult because (one of) the adults were acting like kids. That just made me more responsible. Interestingly enough, I don’t think I’ve progressed much from that eleven year old’s level of independence, but maybe I’m just making stuff up now.

Bonus question:

To complicate things further, but since I’m ranting, why not! I have always had an interest in kink, and being the submissive during impact play. Even as a little child, I remember trying to act out scenes of spanking with my friends.",mentalhealth,2021-01-24 22:42:56

I don't feel sad at all, except every 1 or 2 months when I randomly have a breakdown, thinking that nothing I do will make me happy and that I am gonna kill myself after high school, so I don't have to deal with the struggles of being an adult.

I don't care about anyone, and what worries me the most is that I don't care about my family at all. A little while ago I realized that if someone from my family would die, that I wouldn't cry at all, and probably wouldn't feel sad. I have done so many things that the internet has told me to do in order to help, but nothing has worked.

My brother (31) is going through a manic episode this week, that has seemingly escalated in the last couple of days. I know he’s managed his BP with medication in the past, but I’m not confident he is still taking it as prescribed. - also not sure that matters, but just sharing what I know..

This last week was the 2 year anniversary of our younger brothers passing, and in the days leading up to it I noticed my brother started ramping up - today he seems to be in a full maniac episode and the last time I saw him at this level he attempted suicide on the other side of it. Naturally, I am extremely worried. We live in different states, and so it’s not something I can casually drop by to check in on. 

What can/should I do to help? I’m worried he won’t listen to me if I plainly say “you might need to check in with your psych” because he thinks he’s in an enlightened state of mind (his words). Should I visit immediately? I can arrange to visit this week, but not sure if it’s the right approach. Is there something I can say to help him understand my concerns?

So yeah, I'm left feeling like a sad waste of space today.",mentalhealth,2021-01-25 00:32:46

I’m finding myself struggling more and more to find a logical reason to keep on living. People always say friends, family, things will get better etc. But I’m sick of fighting all the time and pretending it’s a life. I have C-PTSD and have experienced enough life for about 5 lifetimes, and I’m just tired. I go to therapy and fight off flashbacks and try not to off myself every year and for what? To work a job I hate and be a slave to capitalism? I don’t want it. And when I think about the life that I do want, it’s not achievable. Either because of money or the government or some other greater force. Humans weren’t made to live like this. We’re not supposed to be forced into staring at a screen all day working in a cubicle just to make enough money to survive. That’s not a life to me. 

So what’s the point? If I can’t live the life I want and do the things I want what’s the point of all this fighting? At least with death I know there will be peace, ya know?

I want to say that I’m not actively suicidal, nor do I have a plan. It’s a passive thing that stays in my mind, and I want to talk about it because I have a feeling other people feel this way too. We can’t just keep putting the “things will get better” bandaid over everything and pretend that’s helping.

They where just regular words but I’d randomly develop something against it. I mean I know it’s not bad but something is just making me not say it. Like when asking for something, I would act like I forgot the word so the other person would fill in the word I couldn’t say. Another example, making habits/routines. I know these are normal, but really often with specific things I feel if I don’t do them something bad will happen. For instance, whenever I wash my hands I have to tap the palm of my left hand twice or something bad will happen. Always put shoes on right to left or bad luck for you. If I do it wrong, even in a rush I take both my shoes of and redo it. When getting dressed, it’s always too to bottom, or something bad will happen. Sit this way before my dad says goodnight or else, then I can lay down. I don’t really get much of a physical reaction if I don’t follow one of these things except for like shutting my eyes really hard/slight twitch. Im sure a lot of this is normal, it just gets really annoying and idk what to do about it. But it’s almost like it controls me.

A few hours later, I received a call from the director of the company (very busy guy) and he spent about 4 hours on a call with me, until about 2 am, shared his story and he told me to not think for one second that I am the only one struggling... that helped tremendously.

Now, it’s my time to get back to the people and I wanna tell the world that you are not the only one struggling. We are going to make a video in which I am going to share my experience to let people know that anyone can be affected.

I wanna invite anyone who feel like sharing an experience on a video to contact me for further discussion. You might not feel like that, but after the people will see that almost every human being is struggling, they will get so much hope for the future.

I just need to vent because I’m horrible at waiting for things to get better.

So, ever since I was a kid, I’ve dissociated. I grew up in a pretty rough situation, and I would zone out so bad that the world around me wouldn’t exist anymore. I don’t zone out that bad anymore, but I’m my opinion, it’s worse than that. It gets hard to empathize with other people, I can’t fully comprehend things, I’m on autopilot for the most part, and decision making is difficult. I was doing pretty good the past few days. I wasn’t dissociating much at all, and things were relatively chill. However, I started getting depressed two nights ago for no reason (this happens often. I’m not exactly sure why I feel worse at night) and I ended up dissociating again. I slept for over 24 hours (don’t ask me how) and I’m still dissociating right now. I’ve tried grounding techniques, but it literally doesn’t do anything for me. And what makes it worse is that I subconsciously overthink everything, and have intrusive thoughts. Seeing as I can’t comprehend things fully in this state, it makes these thoughts feel like actual delusions which isn’t pleasant. When I’m fully here, I can easily decipher things, so I’m not actually delusional.

As for anxiety, as I mentioned above, I overthink a lot. I’m not consciously overthinking situations, it’s just thoughts racing in the back of my head, which I have zero control over. It often makes me feel anxious over things that aren’t probable, and hinders my ability to do stuff sometimes. There’s times where I have to leave when watching a movie with family because something in the movie will trigger a thought.

Does anyone have any tips or advice on how to deal with those feelings so I can hopefully face my past and move on?",mentalhealth,2021-01-25 01:39:12

Currently been dealing with bad depression, anxiety, stress and major paranoia. Also eating disorders I still haven’t recovered from for over 8 years and I’m just so exhausted.

I have lost all my friends, I barely talk to my family, besides my mom and sister maybe. That also is a stretch because it’ll be weeks before they ask anything about my mental health.
(My mental health and everything else is pretty known in my immediate family &amp; “friends” I had)

The only person I have is my boyfriend which is lovely but sucks sometimes because of my trust issues. I literally overthink everything because I’m scared he’s gonna leave me and forget about me like everyone else. I’m so scared about it... I get so paranoid sometimes I’ll suspect him of something when there’s nothing wrong. I hate myself for it. I hate myself so much sometimes. He’s the best thing that’s honestly ever happened to me. He has saved me so many times and even comforted/loved me when no one else would. But my stupid mental health just fucks everything up for me. 

We communicate about everything and we’re fairly good at it, we always try to understand ones feelings every single time and always come to an understanding. I just don’t know what to do anymore I don’t want to lose him because he’s all I have left. 

It honestly breaks my heart that my “friends” don’t talk to me anymore because I’ve been such a good friend in my eyes with every single one of them. I know I can be annoying or obnoxious sometimes but damn it just hurts that they forgot about me or don’t want to talk to me anymore. I’ve opened up about all my problems too and nobody seemed to really care. At that point I just stopped conversing with them and they just soon forgot about me. It’s honestly bullshit but I guess it just is what it is you know??? 

Sorry I’m just rambling on an on I’m trying my hardest to be independent but it’s all hitting me at once and I feel myself crumbling into a very bad spot. I’ve never felt so alone in my life man :/",mentalhealth,2021-01-25 01:41:57

All I do is work. But recently I just screwed up and my missing work piled. Then the worst possible thing happened, my mother who’s strict on good grades found out about my slacking. Which turned into constant belittling remarks like “you’ll never get into a good college” and more I can’t remember. I finally caught up on my schoolwork and my mother somewhat backed off. My father doesn’t have any presence in my school life and I don’t want to put a burden on my friends.

I'm getting a ton of work but I have no motivation because schools are not being held in person. Being isolated has made me feel alone and unsupported. I am missing milestones and experiences and I am angry, frustrated, upset, and mad. And it doesn't help when you're witnessing the government falling apart before your eyes. To get to my point: I had one of my bad days. I got triggered while doing work for school. Having no outlet to express my feelings, I wanted to destroy something. The first thing I thought about was my hair. I wanted to be rebellious. It didn't seem like anything mattered anymore, not even my hair which I cared about so much. Impulsively, I went into the bathroom, got the scissors, and started cutting my hair. I chopped off the front strands of my hair and then I realized what I was doing and I stopped, but the damage was already done. So now I have this weird haircut where the front part is short but the back is super long. To be honest, the cut is not the worst thing, but it's a big change for me and now every time I look in the mirror, I'm reminded of how messed up my life is. Any other seniors who are in the same boat? Or just anyone in general whose year is shitty? And has anybody here ever cut their hair on impulse due to emotional distress?",mentalhealth,2021-01-25 01:48:01

I'm broken and I don't know how to fix myself.,"I don't know where to start with all this.  It seems like every time I try to get some help or advice I just get told I need to shape up.  I have thought about how I can fix myself time and time again but I just can't find a solution.  

So from my early teens up to now (I'm 25), I have never had a close friend.  I've had ones that come and go but nobody close.  As a young teen, I was always told that it would get better year after year.  So I took comfort in that and waited for that moment to come.  Turns out, I graduated and I celebrated without any friends congratulating me.  Family is great and all but I also wanted to have some friends to hang out with... And I just never got that.  I was very upset that I graduated with the broken promise of getting friends and actually having a life.  

Later on, family told me that once I went to college, things would turn around.  So I trusted them on that and became hopeful for the future.  I also was told that in time I would figure out what career path I would like to go down.  Once again I was hopeful for the future.  

Well a few years go by and I start to realize that nothing that I was told would actually come true.  I forced myself to go to college only to drop out the second semester.  I forced my self to go two more times only to keep dropping out.  Also, I didn't meet any friends, or met a girl.  

By this time, (I was around 24) I thought I just needed to leave home and be on my own.  I thought that would jump start what ever I was lacking and enable me to actually enjoy my 20s.  And so I moved out.  I was very hopeful for the future.  My family was also starting to drive me nuts as well.  

So now I moved into a house and rented one room.  Currently, I am the only person in the house as the owner is overseas.  So yeah, I'm very much by myself now.  

Now that I have moved out, I realized that I wasn't taught a thing about dating and about obtaining friends in general.  I do have some distant friends that I see from time to time, but I never get much of a chance to see them.  Anyways, I have no idea how to get out there and find friends.  I've closed myself in a box for over a decade and I don't know how to closely bond with anyone.  I feel I talk to people just fine but nothing drives me to connect closely with that person.  

I feel like the more times I admit this, the stupider I feel.  Most times people just tell me that I am all wound up for nothing and need get out there and get a life. Funny enough, this actually discourages me even more because I don't know how to get a life. I have no idea what I'm doing.  And most of the time people chuckle and tease me at this point because I sound downright pathetic....apparently. 

Since living by myself, I see my younger siblings getting close to others and approaching marriage.  They are pursuing college and what they enjoy doing.  They are making pretty good money as well.  Then I look at myself and realized that all the promises made to me as a late teen were just bs.  Instead of having a close relationship with someone, I do nothing in my room.  Instead of pursuing a career in college, I work retail jobs.  Instead of feeling like I have close friends, I feel isolated and feel like no one gives a hoot about me.  

I've tried some dating apps and they gave some false hope.  I just don't have any idea how to take a good photo of myself or even to talk to girls on tinder.  I'm clueless. I always end up deleting my dating profile because I get discouraged.  

It's been about four months of living by myself.  Im pretty sure I'm getting worse and worse each day.  I get sad and pissed at myself more and more.  I feel defeated and the last guy on everyone's minds.  I sometimes tell myself that I blew my chance for friends and a happy relationship.  I don't feel there is much hope.  All that optimism I had when I was younger about my future never amounted to anything.  

I'm thinking about buying an instrument to get my mind off my sadness and actually develope a talent.  Should I find a therapist?  

I'm not sure how much more misery I can stand.  It's getting very, very old.  I'm getting more and more broken.  I've even started smoking in hopes that it blocks some of the sad, empty feelings that I am facing.  It kinda works but I fear it will eventually spiral into an uncontrollable addiction.  

Any thoughts or advice is very much appreciated.",mentalhealth,2021-01-25 01:58:38

[TW cutting, scissors, sh, suicidal thoughts, ed]

I wondering if anyone has been to one of those mental health hospital things and if they could tell me a bit about them

I've seen a few thing about them online, but I haven't looked into them much. I know there are no sharp things anywhere, no where you can hurt yourself, etc. How do people get put into them? How do people get out? Do you pay (in canada)?

I have two main reasons I have these questions 

First off, I want to be aware and inform myself. I want to know what these are, if they are positive or negative, etc

Secondly, I think it might be benificial for myself to be in one for a bit. Take this with a grain of salt because I barely know anything but it might be. I've been trying to stop sh, its a lot like a addiction. I've been having a lot of highs (I was even like 5 days without breaking skin) but some days are really really low and I end up with a lot of sh (normally I take scissors and make patches of snips in my skin because I am staying away from blades) and suicidal thoughts. I'm thinking that for my safety and mental health it may be worth it to do something that would get me put into one of these (or pay for one? Or however it works). I just want a safer environment while I work on recovery because I see myself falling into patters of giving up and snipping myself a lot and I dont want to loose my battle yet. I also have been really suffering in the eating department, I have barely been eating anything and I think being in a place with more awareness around eating properly and possibly people to monitor/work through this with me could help.

I'm used to having massive panic attacks that last for weeks/months, but now I've had maybe four bad days in total. I think this partly has to do with working less hours per week (job change, in mental health care ironically) and less social pressure (all our friends live far away so seeing them usually takes up a full day).

But now I've just blown through my energy reserves it seems. There is no longer anything to look out to, my husband called in sick from work with a severe burn out and worst of all I think we are all staving off to some cival wars. 

Last night my government installed a curfew (Netherlands) and there have been riots and looting in 10 (!) different cities. They destroyed shops and even tried to smash in the windows of the hospital in which my mom works. That was the final straw for me. 

I can't handle the covid deniers anymore, or the conspiracy theorists. Or people who deliberately destroy the environment. Or when you ask people not to use the wood stove this week (government request) because the weather conditions make it bad for asthmatic people and then they start doing it on purpose because ""if you tell me I can't do it I'm especially gonna do it"". I can no longer stand the people who are ""rebelling"" against nothing, those 40-year-old manchildren throwing a tantrum. People who never get outside after 9PM and now that there's a curfew they feel the need to go loot things from the business people they claim to want to defend. I can't handle the fact that vandalism is so common in this city that I've already had to change windshield wipers on my car 3 times, or that there can not be lne sibgle art/nature installation without it being stolen or vandalised.

I get panic attacks often.  I was taking psychiatrist medicaments and talking with psychologist, but after I got some symptoms (turned out to be unrelated and not dangerous) I was scared and asked parents to stop taking it. But later, anxiety came back, I think it's even worse. I try to hide these attacks from parents, but it's hard to live with them.

They are convinced it's dangerous to take, but I was feeling better after it. And they deny me psychologist help, because they fear she will talk to psychiatrist and I will have to take these again.

What arguments can I use and how to start the conversation? Last time I wanted to start an unusual topic I got scared so bad I've got depersonalisation. Since that, I try to avoid these topics.",mentalhealth,2021-01-25 02:50:09

I also was arguing over nothing to my family members and overall just felt like I was out of control and wanted everything to end already. I have never actually attempted to commit any harm to myself but I have thought about it. Fortunately I have a good mindset to always think about the future and got out of this situation but still couldn't focus. I was pretty sure I had adhd before but was now sure due to almost all of the stuff happening to me and not being able to control my impulses. Recently I was getting worse and didn't want to go to a doctor due to the fact Covid is still spreading so I wanted to hold off and was also nervous to tell my parents. Since this wasn't going to happen I decided to try some helpful self treatment for myself and I can without doubt say that if you are feeling down or stressed you should try meditation. I tried it first time a week ago and so far have felt better about myself and have gotten more physical active and active in school work. I recommend just going online or downloading an app and trying one about gratitude. I have realized more of what others do to help me and have gotten closer to family. I'm still working on myself and trying to see if I can get some other help with my possible adhd soon. If you are having any of these issues I recommend trying meditation.,mentalhealth,2021-01-25 03:36:19

I struggle with trauma, anxiety disorder &amp; agoraphobia. Near the beginning of the COVID pandemic I had a very bad falling out with a good friend of mine, partially due to me being paranoid.
So this now ex-friend has congenital heart disease; obviously that leaves her immunocompromised, and in turn is more susceptible to contracting a severe form of COVID. This was back in March of 2020 and I was getting extremely anxious and paranoid about the situation. My roommate and ex friend planned to go into NYC for a free concert before COVID hit the states; and as I was reading about the news of ppl getting it in NYC and how fast it was spreading there, I began to mention to them that maybe they shouldn’t go into the city and to just call it off. My ex friend wasn’t really worrying about it at the time and my roommate was just going to see what happened as it got closer to the day of the concert.
I did continue to mention, more so to my friend at the time to maybe reconsider, and she did end up getting annoyed at me which I fully understand. This was just before the major falling out btw. When it actually happened, she refused to speak to me or acknowledge my messages, I reached out to her multiple times and started the conversation, in that time also apologizing for being extremely overbearing and explaining that I just wanted her to be safe and not get hurt. She never spoke to me directly.
She did tell my roommate that she thought I was “unable to be reasoned with when angry”, and that “mental health doesn’t excuse behavior”.

That really ticked me off honestly because I acknowledged and apologized to her for being very insistent on them changing their plans. I’m hurt that she would use that statement towards me when I’ve been actively getting help for the things I struggle with for over ten years and I am always mindful of how I act around others. I’m not going out of my way to act like a piece of shit and then play it off by saying that I have a mental illness. I understand that I can have this almost OCD-like need to check in with people and to know what’s going on but I never have negative intent, I usually do it to make sure that the people I’m checking in on are safe.
I just wish instead of using that statement and refusing to talk to me, that she would have told me that it bothered her and privately asked me to stop. She did tell me to stop, but she did it in an antagonistic way; but regardless of the way she said it, and the way her saying it made me feel, I recognized what I was doing and did stop. At that point in time I was almost frantic and I felt justified by being very careful and paranoid; I wholeheartedly did not realize that it was annoying and overbearing at the time, as that tends to happen sometimes; my blinders go on and I just feel like I NEED to know that people I care about will be okay. And I just wanted to make sure she stayed safe since at the time she didn’t seem like she was taking the situation seriously. I feel like my concern, as overbearing as it was, was excused as abuse or toxic, and it hurt even more when she knows detailed information about what I go through to be somewhat insensitive and see me as “unable to be reasoned with when angry”.

The whole situation caused me to spiral into a severe depression and I self-harmed for the first time in years. I felt terrible and like I was at fault because I wanted to make sure she didn’t get COVID, because to her it absolutely could be fatal. 
I greatly understand and agree with the statement of “mental health doesn’t excuse poor behavior”, and I did acknowledge it and apologize but she still said those things after the fact. My roommate is still friends with her, and to this day my ex friend feels like she is completely in the right for ceasing all contact with me, even after I reached out to her more than once. She never spoke to me in any regard or acknowledged what I had to say or my feelings in the matter. She only recently acknowledged my apology about being overbearing during the whole concert situation. She does not know how deeply her not speaking to me or acknowledging my feelings hurt me. I have trust issues and am afraid of losing people because of that whole thing.

Most of all it upsets me that I would be lumped in with folks who actually use their mental illness to be assholes and excuse their genuinely toxic and abusive behavior. That’s what I equate the “mental health doesn’t excuse behavior” statement with. It just really hurt to be thrown in with people who act poorly or genuinely harm others and try to get away with it because they have a mental illness. I was genuinely afraid for her safety and I feel like my concern was invalidated and that I was being a bad person for wanting her to be safe. Like I said I know I was overbearing and I acknowledged that, but I wasn’t trying to be harmful.

Essentially being told that I’m using my mental illness to harm someone, and then also being told that I am an unruly individual and cannot be reasoned with just really hurts. And I know I was in the wrong for being so overbearing and constantly asking them to cancel their plans, but what gets me is that I only had good intentions and I wasn’t attempting to use my mental illness for personal gain or as an excuse for being toxic or abusive. I just didn’t want to see my friend get sick.

I constantly go back and forth to myself that I was a bad person for that, but then also feeling angry for being seen in such a way when I was only looking out for a friend. My own therapist even said it was wrong of her to use that statement pertaining to me, but it still bothers me. The way she handled it by refusing to talk things out in any way when I reached out makes me feel like I’m the problem and that she refuses to acknowledge my feelings on the matter. As of today she thinks it’s over and done with and that it’s too late to reach out. I just feel like trash and sometimes I feel like I’m the root of the problem and that I should’ve kept my mouth shut.

I’ve been working on that need to check in with people to an unhealthy degree with my therapist, and I don’t do it as much anymore, which I’m glad about. Sometimes I just feel like the progress I make isn’t enough and being compared to genuinely toxic abusive ppl upsets me; because now I just feel like I’m just as bad as them because of what I did that ruined a friendship.",mentalhealth,2021-01-25 03:40:13

As we all grew up I realized that people's jokes weren't really jokes anymore and the things they say no matter in what way would hurt people. A few unfortunate decisions led to me being on the receiving end of this. I kept on internalizing this and it just made me heavier. As this happened more and more I realized most of my relationships became and are toxic. I didn't know what to do and lost a sense of purpose. I didn't have any quote-unquote real friends. This became a cycle and my mental health struggled. I constantly doubted myself and didn't know how to handle situations. This altered my performance in school and ability to do a lot of things as well as my personality. After drastic steps and the failure of those, I confided in someone. This person helped lift me from the dumps I was in and I surrounded myself with people who genuinely cared for me. There are moments when I doubt that as well but I am working on it to make myself the best possible person I can be. My advice for people going through what I did is to change the people you are with. It is ok to cut off ties and find new people. End it on good terms. Talk and confide in someone. Do what you enjoy and not for the sake of what makes you accepted. Sooner or later you will be accepted for what you enjoy doing.

I told my mother about it, that I don't wanna live anymore. She listened but did not do anything. Days went by and I can't take it anymore. I told my mom, that if she does not do anything, if she does not take me to a hospital or make me see a Psychiatrist, I'll really do it. So she took me to a Psychiatrist. Thankfully I recovered. Last time, during my 1st episode, I talked heart to heart with my mom, told everything about my problems and she told me that I should really open up more to her. Sometimes, my depression comes back. And when I try to talk about my feelings to my mom, she dismisses me and says that I should not think about it, that I should not stress myself about things. Then everytime I consult with my doctor, after our session, my mom asks me what I told my doctor. Asked me what's my problem. I just tell her that it's just a follow-up checkup, nothing to worry about. I learned not to talk to her about my problems anymore.
P.S. Don't get me wrong, I love my mother but these experiences is just so disappointing.

Just an example - the first few weeks I started at work, I got so anxious and stressed over the tiniest things.

She's 25 almost, I think the main source of her unhappiness at first was that that she's having a hard time finding a job.

At first I thought it was just that, unhappiness and discomfort from being unemployed, and staying at home my parents pressure her a lot (but I'll come back to my parents later on).

The first clue that she's depressed is that she often feels physically bad: she has constant headache and sometimes other problems too. She's been to the doctor multiple times now, and nothing major has come out of it. 

But one day she burst out crying and said that she hates her life and expressed her suicidal thought.

My heart fucking broke. 

I tried to comfort her saying she's not alone, and that this feeling will pass one day she just doesn't know it now. I know sometimes people say this stuff out of desperation, but it sounded like a cry for help and I genuinely feared for her because I know first hand that feeling and it's a very complicated and dark place to be in.

As this wasn't enough, my parents make it worse: they are hard working people, relativley young, but so old school about mental health in general.

And by that I mean they think my sister is just lazy and having tantrums. They often make things worse when they speak, even when they try to ""comfort"" her they say very wrong things such as ""you should be strong"" and ""of course you have headache you always sit in the house all day"". They also indirectly make her feel bad because she spends money with all these doctors appointments.

Therapy is not available and people would say I'm making excuses for being lazy/stupid if I tell them about my mental health issues. Since I was a kid, I've always been someone who is emotional, easily triggered, easily stressed out, and tends to overthink. Everyone, even my parents, sees me as ""weak, oversensitive, and dramatic"". They don't believe one can be struggling mentally when they look just fine and ""normal"" physically. There were some critical points in my life when I got panic attacks and cried everyday, I couldn't eat or sleep and was losing weight but my parents were totally helpless (and clueless) because I didn't seem to be sick anywhere looking from the outside.

I don't blame my parents for neglecting my mental health though. They live in such conservative society and had a hard time making ends meet, so I doubt they even have time to learn about something so foreign to them. I blame the whole ""cultural stigma"" in general. I feel like a misfit. I just wish I could get out of this prejudiced place asap, move to a different country where mental health is prioritized, where people understand me and I'm not considered ""crazy"".

I just needed somewhere to talk about my feelings.
I’ve recently moved into my first house with my partner and within our first month, we have gone into another lockdown. I have really been struggling with it,  at this point I just need normality. What’s worse is that my family have lost another member. I lost my first grandfather in August, and my remaining grandfather passed away last week. It hasn’t hit me yet (it didn’t until the funeral of my other grandfather) and what’s worse is that I can’t see my own dad. I want to hug him and grieve with him.

On top of this, I am a university student. This is my final semester and I just feel so unmotivated and done with it all. I have three assignments due next month, my dissertation in May and I’ve barely started any of it because I’m just lost. I feel like I have no purpose! My partner is amazing and so supportive but he works and also has sleep issues so we haven’t been sleeping in the same bed, adding to my loneliness. 

On top of this, I feel guilty? I feel guilty for not wanting to go to work. I feel guilty for wanting to go ‘forget it’ and break lockdown rules. I feel guilty for complaining when I have a stable job that I just hate at the moment because it’s full of negative interactions.",mentalhealth,2021-01-25 05:26:51

I’m really sorry that this is formatted horribly. I’m on mobile and I’ve also never really made a post like this. 

I (F16) have been in therapy for nearly 5 years. It’s helped and I’ve made a lot of progress. I went from self harming everyday to maybe doing it twice a month, but recently I’ve noticed I’ve been getting worse. I can feel a mental breakdown coming on, like I’m not having one currently, but I’m in the stages of it. I think part of this is me coming to the realization that my girlfriend sexually assaulted me in the beginning of our relationship. She also lied to me about having a miscarriage when she was younger which makes me hesitant to believe the things she tells me. She gaslights me, makes me feel stupid, and makes me feel like I’m a horrible person (which I have problems with already). She’s cheated on me too. I’m still with her and I’m scared to break up with her because I feel like she will hurt herself. I haven’t really talked to her in 20 something days. I told her I needed a break from everything. She sends me a goodnight text every night and sends me texts throughout the day telling me about how much she loves and misses me and says that she can’t wait until I come back. I talked to my friend about the assault and they said I might not have communicated my boundaries with her well enough. I told my girlfriend “no” multiple times, but she continued until I started to cry. After I started to cry she hugged me and said she was sorry and it wouldn’t happen again, but it happened another time after that. I don’t know what to do. I love her a lot, but she scares me now and I can feel my mental health deteriorating. I’ve started to self harm more often now and I can’t help, but feel it’s because of the assault. She’s made me feel like if I leave her I won’t find anyone again and that no one will want me. I feel like all of this is my fault and that I deserve all of the pain I’m going through.

One of my very close friends, in the last six years, have been emotionally attached to nearly 10 people, all ending in ruin and garbage fire, and yet they don't seem to learn even a single bit or see any patterns in their behaviour. They've a lot of trauma from childhood and these abusive attachments have only aggravated their mental health issues. Me and my other friends have tried to get them to therapy, or any sort of professional help, but my friend has managed to circumvent each of these conversations to the point where we are still watching helplessly as they fling themselves towards yet another terrible person in the hopes they'll 'complete' them. 

(If you have watched Crazy Ex Girlfriend, then you'd know that my friend is uncannily like Rebecca Bunch). 

They're in another country so it has been difficult to physically meet up with them and check on them, and I'm constantly worried if they'll do anything self destructive. (For context, they've tried to self-harm in the past). I don't know how to help my friend. All of us suffer from variable mental health issues and all of us, save this friend of ours, now undergo therapy and it really has gotten better. I don't know how to convince an adult to seek out help and I don't seem to have the energy to fight someone else's battle for them.

This will probably be long. 

For context, I’m 17(f) and I’ve got pretty severe depression, anxiety and ptsd ever since I was about 10. I’m a twin, but my twin died of sids. 

Mom is a hardworking nurse that has two life altering conditions, one of them she’s got to get surgery for every 5 years. She’s got pretty bad depression. Has to work her ass off going into work at 7 and coming home at 7 almost every single day. 

Dad is a hard worker with pretty bad bipolar 2, he has depression and ocd. He switches jobs a lot but you’ll never see him without one unless he’s in a bad episode. He once had a grand mal seizure about ten years ago that stripped him of his cdl license which lost a very good paying job. He couldn’t work for two years. He applied for disability because of mental health issues but was denied. 

Brother has brain damage epilepsy, sort of unnoticeable seizures of multiple days a week but a pretty bad one more than every once in a while. He tried going to college but the seizures were too much and he can’t drive so ultimately he can’t have much of a career. He was denied disability. 

Because of my dads major seizure ten years ago, he went without work for two years because they stripped him of his license. My mom had to work two jobs, take us kids to school, deal with our problems and her own surgeries and eventually we lost our two story childhood home. We now live in a somewhat decent mobile home for about 4 years? No yard or backyard, very small but.. nice.  

Ever since I was young I’ve wanted go be a psychologist so bad. I had a couple of branches picked out and I have actually studied for it for a very long time. It’s now come to my realization though that my dream job is turned into a chore, and it’s something that I’m going to have to do to help my family and I, as I am going to have to take care of my brother and help my parents. 

My brother can only work part time jobs, the seizures are so bad usually when he’s under stress and he’s got legions in he brain that are possibly going to continue to get bigger the older he gets. I want to make my parents life as easy as possible and my brother well cared for. He isn’t helpless, but since he’s been denied disability we’ve come to agree I need to take care of him. 

With this though, it means I’m going to have to take care of him, have a job, study in college, have the strength to wake up and get out of bed, deal with my constant nightmares, buy him and my medication, schedule appointments, pay for any hospital trips, etc. 

The reason why all of my family and I decided one why I should be the one to take care of him and provide for the family (the providing part isn’t necessary to them, I just want to) is because I’m the only one without physical disabilities that hinder me, which is true. 

But now, my dream job just looks like such a chore, so far out of reach. It would take 5-7 years of college, and I realize if I want to be some form of a psychologist, I need to have my shit together too. 

I’ve attempted suicide in the past thats landed me in the psych hospital several times and as early as I can remember I can vaguely remember as a 7 year old lying in bed and choking myself. 

I remember truly purposely trying to break my arm just to see what it was like, not for the cast like some kids want to have it signed, but I wanted to break my arm, I only got as far as fracturing it with something heavy and I got a splint. 

Over the years my self harm has gotten pretty bad and though I can be clean for months (I relapsed couple months ago but before that I was clean for maybe almost a year again) I have a pretty bad obsession with it. Not for the pain or even the numbness it gives me but for the the mutilation aspect in a sick part of my brain that I finally figured out not to long ago. (Just in case this needs to be said I have no desires of hurting others, that makes me sick lol) 

Back in august, I had such a bad fight with my dad about all of these topics that I had to fly out to another state to just be away and think about things. It did wonders for us actually and we’ve all been content as a family for a while now, it was the best decision, but I’m going to be 18 soon and with that comes with the rest of life. 

College, getting a job, paying bills, waking up and doing basic hygiene without feeling forced, taking care of others, etc. I just feel so overworked and that I’m shouldering so much. 

I know it’s selfish to feel this way, but I just want to continue being a kid. Not because I don’t want responsibility, but because I know I’m safe and I can be with my mom and dad and not have to worry about a thing. 

I don’t want to have to think and try because I’ve been trying all of my life and it’s so hard. The more I think of it the more I realize I just want to die. The only reason I’m here is because I know it’s absolutely crush my family if I did anything, I can’t bear to see my family cry. I’m extremely empathetic and love them with all my heart. But I shouldn’t have to only be alive just because others want me to? Shouldn’t I be alive because I want to? 

I’ve been thinking really hard about being admitted again lately but it feels like I’ve just come to a standstill and that nothings going to change. I’ve gone to therapy, my favorite therapist I love I had to stop seeing, I don’t want to seek help another way through religion. 

I’m just so tired and I just want to be happy with my friends and family but I’m not.

Just one year ago all of my mental health problems started to get visible. I told my ex girlfriend that I'm not sure what do I feel to her and I felt completely lost. I've started to looking in her bad things/things that irritate me. Everything started to irritate me. Most of the things that she did different than me. I felt deeply that I love her so much, but I was constantly irritated. I didn't see that I was rude in that moment but now after we broke up and she started bringing up the past (like constantly, we texted after break up 6 months  but basically she was only picking up bad moments, this really affected me). The scary thing is, that she was my first love and first girlfriend and in first year everything like was perfect. 

I asked my mom, did I was a bad kid in the past or was constantly irritated and she responded that sometimes yes or I did something only to get start an argument. 

I think that this can have a base in my parents relationship. My dad has problems with alcohol and was unemployed most of my life. Finally I kicked him out of our house for the good of my mom. She wasnt able to do that.

I think that Im a bit egoistic and I need to say more good things, thanks and give things people. I gifted my girlfriend a lot, like but I felt that she could do better (she was basically 5x richer than me and I was a kid from a poor family but good job).

Can anyone relate with this problem?

Another story is fear of getting into relationship. My family is a bit far away and I got only my mom and I fear that my next gf would be aware that I don't have nice family and big house. I also fear that I don't have many friends where do I live and that could be a problem. 

I cannot be happy during dating, due to awareness and fear of my problems and still thinking about my ex (who certainly will not message me anything good in next months).

I would be grateful for telling me stories of passing the egoistic approach, constant fear and irritation.

Thanks.",mentalhealth,2021-01-25 05:40:22

 Over the past eight months I've ended up injuring a bunch of joints because of my own stupidity. I injured my right wrist specifically the triangular fibrocartilage complex in a game of mercy at school. The injury won't heal and it has made it so I can't do any kind of lifting or physical activity. It is a constant tightness in the area and makes me be constantly careful of how I twist it so that I don't hurt it more. I can't play any sports, can't go to gym, can't even hold plates in my hand without a pressure forming on it. It feels awful and even now eight months later it still hasn't healed fully, despite me seeing a physiotherapist. There has been improvement, but it feels so slow and it being back to normal feels so far away.

I injured my knee when I was messing around with my friends. We were wrestling and I guess too much pressure was put on it because there was an audible snap and it was extremely painful to walk on afterwards. I'm not sure exactly what is wrong with it but physio seems to be helping. I have no idea how long until it is back to normal though.

I injured my left wrist in an arm wrestle. I kick myself for this one because apparently I didn't learn my lesson. It is the same injury as the first though not as bad. However, it is yet another thing that just feels awful constantly. I have to be so careful grabbing anything because both my hands feel so weak. It is like I am walking on eggshells in my own body so I don't set anything off. Because of all this I also can't get a job as most require some form of lifting or standing for at least six hours; which just wouldn't work with my knee.

On top of all that I'm freaking out because my elbow has been sore when I stretch it and I am so worried about another joint injury that will take months to heal. Since I haven't been able to do anything I've gotten depressed and gained ten kilos over the eight months. I feel fat and awful and there is just no way I can do anything to fix it. I feel bored and stupid for not appreciating what I was able to do when I was healthy and would do anything to go back to before I got hurt. My parents want me to work and we've had arguments because they think I'm fine and healed when it is the exact opposite. I hate feeling like I am being judged like I am making it all up. I just want to be normal again. Without any pressure or pain in my knee, able to twist my wrists without any pain shooting up them, not have to stress about another potential injury that will incapacitate me for even longer.

I'm only eighteen but it feels like my body is breaking apart. I feel fat, awful, lazy, depressed and stressed about what is going to happen. I feel like I've been cheated, the injuries I've gotten have been debilitating and they came around from such normal things. Not the type of stuff that should stop me doing anything for what will likely be a year. I've had people tell me it is my own fault, that I shouldn't have played stupid games; but how was I meant to know it'd be this bad? I had never been injured before these and I seem to have gotten every injury that is impossible to heal.

I just hate this, I want to be normal again. I want to be able to do sports, go back to gym, lose all the weight I've gained but I can't. I feel like I'm just stuck in injury limbo.",mentalhealth,2021-01-25 05:53:46

For starters I’ve gone from being so busy to being inside for almost a year. Before quarentine I guess being busy distracted me . I’ve lost all joy in things I used to love so much, like playing music. I just have no motivation to do anything. 
It’s a constant cycle of just not sleeping, staying up until I’m about to pass out . Sleeping makes me sad and I’m tired of being exhausted all the time. I’m finding it hard to remember things, it’s so foggy, even yesterday. I hate it. Is this just normal? 
No motivation. I’ve let my room just consume me and I have no energy to do anything about it. Finding it hard to do assignments in school, being distant with friends, when they do really make me happy even if it’s for a moment. 
I’ve had problems with opening up for as long as I can remember, but it’s getting to the point I don’t even tell myself about it, if that makes sense. I don’t know who I am fully rested and taken care of. It’s just so hard to do the littlest things and I keep psyching myself out about it because I don’t know what to do. Maybe I’m just fucking lazy I don’t even know how to explain it because I’ve never really written it out or talked to anyone about it. 
To be honest my parents really aren’t much help. They nag me about my room which is understandable,, it’s a reck. And I try, I promise I try. And when our fights get really bad I try to open up. And they just say I’m making up excuses. Say I do nothing. And I know I do nothing. I feel useless I feel like nothing . I don’t even have anything to make me feel like this. To make me feel nothing for months and then crash. Is this just a normal quarentine problem? Or do I need to talk to someone?",mentalhealth,2021-01-25 06:16:14

I often smoked a lot of marijuana and so my sleeping habits were similar to an induced coma. I remember hearing my mum yelling, but as we often had people coming in and out of the house- and my mum was a loud and sometimes aggressive person- my brain told me not to stress and to doze back off. I repeated this several times, before eventually waking up. I wont go into heavy details of what happened after that, except for screaming, a lot of blood everywhere, and trying to keep my dad alive long enough till the ambulance came... but once the madness settled, and everything returned to normal within my family (to some degree- as a police investigation ensued, then later a raid on our household- which also happened while i was freaking sleeping), i was having instances where everytime i closed my eyes, the night of what my dad went through would be all that i could see. I knew this moment would pass, and i would try my best to push the thoughts aside. 

But then i began experiencing symptoms whilst i was unconscious too- and during my sleep, i would wake up and walk down to the front lounge, and stare out the window facing the road. I would just stand there for ages, not really aware of what i was doing, or how long i stood there for, but i did know that i was ‘guarding’ the house to a degree- like my guilt of partially sleeping through the initial incident kept me in a state of, “... you wont catch me out again. Ill see you coming this time. Ill protect this house.” Then after some time, in my half-sleepy state, i would feel calm that no invading attackers were going to run up my front lawn, and i would walk back to my room and fall asleep again.

I did this for a few weeks. Unaware that my random sleepwalking was a symptom of post traumatic stress. I think we were then reached out to by ‘victims of crime’ who asked if we were suffering any ptsd, and as my only knowledge of that was what soldiers experienced after coming back from war (from the movie ‘flatliners’), i’d said ‘no’ as it wasnt to that degree (such as flashbacks triggering suicidal thoughts)... but after i told her about my wierd nightly walks to observe the front yard while sleeping, she said that was a sign of post traumatic stress. I had no idea i was so affected... (which may sound strange but my family’s culture was to downplay everything). I didnt get therapy, i just assumed it would pass on it its own, which it did, but it would get triggered every now and then (like around that time of year)... 

But now that i live in my own place with my fiance, he sometimes struggles to understand my paranoia at night, as i often have dreams that someone is breaking in, or i cant sleep because i swear i can hear noises and i have to check that no one is in our house like 4-7 times before going to bed. I also jump out of my skin if he gets out of bed during the night as im like, “this is it! Its an intruder!”

Hate myself for dropping out of college, recently losing a job, and plenty other things. Basically the only reason I’m still alive is I love my boyfriend and want a future with him for his sake, and the occasional love I receive from my immediate family.


A few days ago I actually realized that yelling, specifically my father’s yelling, really shuts me down and freaks the fuck out of me. I’ve never had a trigger so I’m not sure what it is. 


Anyway. Some days I literally cannot get out of bed and would rather stay there for months. Today was one of those days and I was screamed at to get up, shower, and to come downstairs for dinner afterwards. I just sat in my shower naked and cried about my failures and my family until they came upstairs again to yell at me some more. My dad yelled at me to look him in the eyes and answer him why I didn’t come for dinner. Between sobs I answered I didn’t want to eat or be seen by anyone, and he interrupted me, screaming he didn’t care what I wanted and if I was told to come downstairs I would do so.


The way my dad deals with anything related to how I feel about myself is simple: he believes I just need to “start making decisions” and everything will start to look up. Sure. Let me just find a reason why my stupid shit ass should get a shit job that I’ll want to die doing anyway, making shit money until I can buy a shit car and not even want to go anywhere with it but OFF A FUCKING BRIDGE

My OCD tells me that I probably hurt my roommates in college because I used to masturbate while they both were in the room with the lights either off or both of them asleep.

It makes me feel like I'll only be free from this thought when I confess this to them. We were three guys in one room, I have confessed to one roommate already. Then I started lexapro and have been able to not confess to the other roommate for the last 3 months. But the thought has never left me, it feels like it will always be there unless I confess. I don't want to live like this.

My OCD also makes me feel like I am stuck with this thought because the thought popped up when I had smoked some cannabis. I haven't smoked since that day but it tells me I have fucked my brain up forever. I had never had a bad experience with cannabis before but I am scared now.

I feel better with Lexapro but this constant awareness of the thought doesn't let me do anything properly or feel anything properly. I know the confession is a compulsion therefore I haven't done it but I don't want to spend the rest of my life in this state of mind.

I am not sure what I am looking for here, maybe some advice or support or your experiences with this. Or any help.

I really hope this is the right section to post this in as I am pretty new to Reddit. I will try to explain it as best as I can.

I hate my breasts and I want to get rid of them or at least reduce their size. I hate seeing them to the point that I feel uncomfortable when changing or taking a shower and I wear loose fitting clothing. I find them physically uncomfortable. I mean, they are just two gross lumps that hang off my chest and rub against my skin which is really uncomfortable and they also restrict movement.

I can not stand to wear a bra as I find them to physically uncomfortable. I can't stand the feeling under my arm and it would get really bad when I sweat as I sweat a lot. I also have an issue with feeling over heated (not sure if me or the fact I live in Australia or both). I do not like the heat or the sun. Also, if I wear a bra, the physically feeling of the bra makes me think of the ugly chest lumps and I feel uncomfortable.

I have hated my chest lumps for a very long time. I was unfortunate enough to hit puberty at the age of 10. My parents at that point started pressuring me to wear a bra which I did not like and actively resisted. I guess that's when the chest lumps started to grow. When I hit the age of 12 to when I was 13, I did come to terms with the chest lumps but then they kept growing so I stopped being at terms with them. I'm not sure if they are still growing. I really hope they aren't.

This breast issue has caused some conflict with my family. Just to note, my parents are split up and have been since I was very young. My dad and step mum gave up on the bra thing after about 1 or 2 years but my mum tried to drill it in until I was about 18 when I guessed we stopped talking about it for the most part.

I have long said I want to have my chest lumps cat off and I guess I get a negative response from my dad and step mum when I say that but react better to breast reduction. My dad has made offers to contribute to the reduction with some strings attached. He keeps moving the goal post on those strings attached making them stricter. This was about 1 to 2 years ago.

One of those relates to wearing a bra which I don't want to live the rest of my life having to wear a bra. He says that I am a woman and women wear bras and I won't get a job or a good job if I don't. He tells me my refusal to wear a bra is making my chest lumps sag and making them increase in size which freaks me out. The other involves seeing a psychiatrist which is a big no because I morally object to psychiatry and various aspects of phycology.

This caused a lot of arguments as both me and my father are very stubborn and I came to the conclusion that we couldn't agree to the strings attached and we stopped talking about the issue. I mean, we did discuss the issue with a doctor I was seeing previously for a bunch of unrelated issues where I tried to awkwardly explain what I was experiencing.

He asked me if I identify or want to be a boy and I said no and he said I therefore weren't gender dysphoric. Around a similar time, a phycologist I was seeing asked me the same question with the same answer. He also determined I don't have body dysphoria as my issues stem from me myself and not over a concern for how other people perceive me.

My dad and step mum have also asked me whether I want to a boy on various occasions to which I responded no. I'm fine with being a girl, I just want to get rid of the chest lumps. I'm biologically female.My dad has told me that no surgeon will help with the breast reduction since I'm not gender dysphoria or something similar and I am not being rational and that I should go and talk to another phycologist or physiatrist and 'admit' I have gender dysphoria.

The chest lumps have been making me unhappy for a reasonable portion of my life and getting rid of them will make me so much happier. I highly doubt that I will regret it. Also, I really do want to have children later in life although I wouldn't be comfortable breast feeding as I do not like looking at the chest lumps.

I just have some questions. Am I the only one who feels the way I do? What options do I have? Is my dad right that plastic surgeons will dismiss me as crazy and will refuse a breast reduction? Does anyone have any knowledge or wisdom that may help me in my situation?

Feel free to ask me any other questions.",mentalhealth,2021-01-25 07:21:00

Sorry in advance!

&amp;#x200B;

I've come here in the hopes that people who are farther along on their mental health journey might be able to help me with a pretty bid decision! I'm 22F and the psychiatrist I'm seeing now is the first mental health professional I've ever seen. I've been diagnosed as bipolar, but from reading other experiences of bipolar people I really begin to wonder why I haven't been told if I'm 1 or 2.

I'll get to the main point though. I pay $200 a month whether I actually get to see my psychiatrist or not. It's an automatic draft kind of like a bill. This does have perks like I'm able to message whenever using an app to get refills or set up appointments and whatnot, but at the same time I just don't feel like I benefit from the services enough to justify that much money on top of my straining budget. 

Financials aside, there's also been a few experiences I've had with this particular clinic that make me skeptical about continuing to go, although it took me years to find this place and I don't have very many resources in my area (Southern US if anyone has any helpful advice!). The main problem I have first and foremost is not feeling like I'm being heard. Like, when I'm there in person she listens and we conversate, but then the treatment plan offered at the end of the session seems to completely ignore my concerns. These feelings started when I was put on a medication that made my heart rate skyrocket, and it took my primary care provider and over a month to convince her that the medication wasn't good for me. 

I have had I believe 2? therapy sessions in the past (although they cost more out of pocket on top of the $200 draft so I can't afford them anymore) that just really didn't feel right to me. Without going into too much detail about the sessions, she said some things to me that I really don't feel were appropriate to tell someone in my situation. There's also the fact that despite reaching out for refills and whatnot there's been no mention of a follow up visit or treating any of the other problems I'm currently dealing with. I last saw her before Christmas.

I kind of pushed this all to the side as accidents happen and this is my first mental health doctor so to speak so I don't have anything else to compare it to. I've mentioned this to a few of my friends and they think it's time to try something new. 

I guess my final questions are this: Is this normal behavior? If not, how do I go about finding more affordable care for someone that doesn't have health insurance? How do I get them to stop billing me?

I'm a high school teen now. 
I come from a slightly above middle-class family. Two years ago, I've discovered that I have OCD and requested my parents for a psychiatrist and they brought me for one. Nonetheless, due to some reasons my parents got into tantrums with the psychiatrist and ended up with some medication for serotonin. That was the first and last meet up with a psychiatrist. My parents leave it for myself to resolve it. My father especially somehow trusted that I can get through it by myself. 
Till date, it's still here, though not so severe, it's not on the far left of the other end. Im spending approx 1/2-1 hr per day for these compulsive rituals. I did some research and found out BCT, ACT, and EPR? I'm really not sure. Should I just ignore it until it's numb? Bcuz it's really hard. The consequences are tangibly unrealistic. But it's all too convincing. 
So I really want to ask for some help. I embrace growth mindset a lot, and I can now feel the anxiety is getting stronger and stealthily destructing my live.(poor interpersonal skills especially) What should I do to constructively obliterate it? 
1. I pray to God every night in obsession. (causing me to have imsonia a lot)- fearing if not done so, my family and I will be in bad luck.

He was acting a bit off towards me but I figured it was because of his mental state. We had a really good Christmas Eve. He started taking some new medication Christmas Eve and the next day it was like a switch had flipped. He was 10 times worse and more withdrawn. 

Over the next few weeks, he didn’t want to make conversation and his texts became patchy. Also he was less affectionate towards me, didn’t want to cuddle etc. He seemed to come out of it a bit and started talking to me more and being more affectionate but still very patchy texts. Then I went around last Sunday. We sort of got in a mild (like two sentences) argument about why he had been ignoring me. Then spent most the night in silence. His gran who he lives with then upset him and he stormed out the house. He spent the next two hours with his head in his hands, either trying not to cry or crying I couldn’t tell because he wouldn’t look at me. Anyway it wasn’t great. When I left I asked him for a hug and he said ok and pulled me close and rubbed my back. I told him I love him and he said it back. That is the last time I saw him. 

I was suppose to go over Thursday but he lost his job Wednesday and had to sort stuff out. Then Saturday I was going to go over but we went back into lockdown. Now I really don’t know what to do. Is communication through text is so patchy and it’s the only way we communicate. Hours to reply, coming online and ignoring messages. Some days are better than others, some he messages me first some I have to message him first. Then he has also stopped doing streaks on Snapchat (we had 566 days) and I don’t know why and it’s making me think he is try to cut contact or something because he doesn’t want me or love me anymore, people keep saying “doesn’t sound like he’s into you” and it’s making me worry.

I have anxiety, and I’m getting very anxious. I feel like I’m going to lose him during this lockdown. I’m not sure what to do. I overthink everything he does. He said we would play Minecraft at some point but don’t know if that will happen. He hasn’t even got a job so  unlike the last lockdown he has nothing to occupy him self with all day. He sleeps until noon or longer too, I have no idea what he spends his days doing.",mentalhealth,2021-01-25 08:25:24

I’m 21M (although this happened when I was 20) and I’ve been working as a bartender on and off (thanks COVID) for the past couple years. At some point, back at the end of 2019, I had a situation where I ended up having to kick a dude out of the venue (he was being rowdy, looking for fights and was more than a little drunk) and obviously he took that about as well as you’d expect. But eventually we got him out the door and slapped him with a ban in the process. Fast forward to closing time and because it was a smaller venue, all the staff had gone home except for me and my manager that night, a woman about 28 years old, about 5’5 and 4 months pregnant at the time. We’re locking up for the night just about to go home when these two guys in black hoodies start walking up to us in the parking lot, one of them is kinda hanging back and the other one is walking pretty purposefully towards us, pretty clear he was coming over to talk to us given that it was 3am in an otherwise empty parking lot. My manager walked toward him a bit and yelled out the venue was closer for the night, cause we both assumed he was just some local drunk who wanted in, happens all the time. Anyway, he just keeps walking and as he gets closer I see the other guy behind him is looking kinda nervous like he can’t decide if he wants to be there or not. That’s when I noticed the front guy has his hands in his pocket and it’s pretty obvious he’s trying to conceal something in there. At that point I stepped in front of my manager and started yelling out to the guy asking what he was doing here. He just kept walking up and when he got within about 10 steps of me he pulled out a knife and stood there, I think he was deciding how far he actually wanted to go at that point now that he’d made it pretty clear what he was doing. He started yelling shit about how we shouldn’t have kicked him out cause he’s got biker friends and saying we’ve gotta lift the ban or he’ll cut us, all the usual drunk butthurt douchebag shit you deal with every time you ban someone. By this point my manager is already on the phone to the police and so I yell out to him that the cops are on the way and that we’ve already got photos of his ID from when he banned him earlier so he better get the fuck outta there if he didn’t feel like spending the next couple years behind bars. His friend was already halfway down the block at this point and eventually after a shitload of grandstanding and name dropping various bikers he was “friends” with (hard to buy into given the dude he ACTUALLY brought with him pissed his pants immediately), the guy finally took off and we got home without a scratch. 

Anyway, not long after that I lost that job cause of COVID and ended up being forced to move around a whole bunch pretty much all last year. I finally got stable able October and managed to find more bar work, and I found that I was a little more hesitant to kick people out or cut them off and was kinda nervous doing really late closes, found myself hurrying to get all the cleaning done each night so I could get out earlier. And now recently they’ve been cutting staff due to a second wave of COVID slowing down business, which includes cutting all the security staff unless there’s a function on that night. Now I’m just finding that I’m dreading late night shifts now (which is the bulk of my shifts) and I don’t know what to do about it. It makes me feel really weak and stupid cause it’s not like I was stabbed or anything, I should be able to shrug off a light threatening, especially since I don’t even think the guy ever intended to actually follow through. I don’t know, it’s like part of me wants to go and get in a bunch of fights just to prove to myself I’m tough enough to handle it, and part of me wants to never leave my front door now.

I probably also have a lot of residual guilt from childhood cause my dad used to be pretty violent, sometimes towards me, but mainly towards my mom and sister. I haven’t been around him since I was about 11, so it might sound stupid to say I feel weak and guilty to have not stood up to him, but I still feel that way regardless, would’ve prefer to get my ass kicked that watch other people get beaten down.

Maybe I need to leave bartending behind, but that feels like I’m letting some loser affect me more that he has any right to. That and I really can’t afford to leave the job, otherwise I would have by now cause this new venue is so poorly managed and shit that they’ve given me practically every reason under the sun to want to leave. Maybe that’s why this things seems to be coming up again now, cause I’ve got a heap of stress from other aspects of the job too but can’t leave.

 It's always been me messaging them, they only talk to me when we end up in a discord call which happens rarely.

Also with some other friends they clearly neglected my presence not even two years ago and still do. They only notice me when I decide to DM them, and once again they only say hello when I suddenly end up in a voice chat with them which is super rare.

 My newer friends I have met in highschool aren't as bad though, but still barely even say hello and ask if I'm ok, the only time last year I was asked if I was okay, was a joke on a mental health awareness day.

honestly since maybe mid-2019 i've been struggling slightly. I remember I went on holiday for a month to Italy (something which is obviously so great and should have been such a nice time) but i felt absolutely nothing in anyway shape of form. i would sit in restaurants w my family and just couldn't bring myself to speak, like i physically didn't have the strength. we visited all the tourist attractions and i have never cared less about anything in my life i just stood their surrounded by people wanting to cry. this is very unusual for me, i have always loved to travel and experience new things. at one point we were in Florence, and my mum was having a go at me about how little i seemed to care about what we were doing and i just burst into tears and said 'i don't feel anything, i'm trying, but i just cant feel a thing'. i don't really remember how the convo ended but i think we both just pretended i hadn't said anything. 

that was in June/July - and it only got worse as the yr went on. i've always enjoyed school and been a very motivated student (always achieved highly academically) but i just couldn't bring myself to do anything - it was like every little thing i did whether it was something simple like organising folders or writing an essay took everything out of me - i would come home from school at 5 and just get straight into bed i was so exhausted - whilst i wasn't enjoying life, i was coping - late or not everything eventually got handed in, my grades were good enough to not warrant my teachers getting involved, i still participated in things with my friends. 

then covid hit back in march (i'm in the UK) and honestly (unpopular opinion haha) but that was the first time in ages i felt truly happy and relaxed. i was thriving in that first lock down. i could d things at my own pace - school hadn't really set up any zoom lessons yet so i could pretty much just do things my way, it was summer so i could go for walks - i definitely had weeks where i was down but nothing compared to how it was before lockdown.

and then august came, school had ended for the yr (thank god lol), covid restrictions were slightly lifted, and i was working at the job i'd had for about year. this was when the UK gov were doing 'Eat Out, to Help Out' for the whole of august and i worked 6 days a week, 9 hrs a day for the whole of the summer holidays. 

if I'm being honest i think this was a real turning point for my mental health. i have worked as a waitress consistently since i was 14 and omg i have never experienced anything like that august. i encountered some of the rudest, self-entitled, scary, intimidating people i have ever met during that month (and i work at a cafe that older people go to!! its not like a bar or anything!) we would be run of our feet from the time i got in at 8 to the time i left at 5 - and by that i mean no time to even have a 5 min break or go to the loo. i would arrive at i would immediately get these hot sweat things and i couldn't breath and i would feel so sick. i remember going home multiple times and just bursting into tears it was honestly one of the worst months of my life and its only gone down hill from there.

since i've gone back into school in September i've felt anxious constantly. i will forget something (like literally just like a book for a class or something i said i would give a friend) and i would need to go have a cry in the toilets, or go outside alone and take deep breaths just feel like i could breathe again

i feel like i'm constantly just going about life doing little things to keep my head above water - and the little things work in the short run, i feel better if i go and get a drink of water, or go and get fresh air, or go and watch my favourite comfort show. but without a doubt the next day, or even the next hour, the feelings of dread, and guilt, and shame and sadness come back and i have to do it all over again. i started getting these obsessive thoughts that i just couldn't let go. like logically i knew they weren't true and would never be true but i was staying up for hours at night thinking about them, or i couldn't focus on tasks without getting distracted by them, and it got to the point were i was having these incidents where i get hot and sweaty, and i couldn't breathe, and my chest and throat felt so tight, i was nauseous and my heart was beating so fucking fast. i have headaches constantly, i go to sleep at like half-7, wake up at 8 and still feel constantly exhausted. 

and then this second (or third idek anymore ha) lock down has happened and i cant sleep, cant focus, i'm going weeks without showing, i cant bring myself to text friends, i'm barely getting any work done, and i just don't care anymore. in the words of Queen 'i don't want to die, but i sometime wish i'd never been born at all' lolll'

sometimes i see a bridge, or a train, or a really big lorry, and i just think to myself - if that hit me i would be okay with it - or if if i was going to kill myself that would be a good place to do it. 

and i just feel so guilty because compared to so many people i am so lucky, and so privileged, and i have amazing friends who i love and my family is fantastic and so supportive and i know if i were ever say anything about this to them they would help me without a second thought 

but then on instagram or whatever, you hear all these people who have mental health issues talking about the different between mental health and a mental disorder - like they say its normal to feel anxious and i just feel so guilty if i were to go to the doctor i'd be taking away resources away from someone who actually needed them - or i'm actually blowing it all out of proportion in my mind and comparatively i'm okay??

also we're not poor but were definitely not well off, and i if i were to ask my mum if i could see a therapist or something - any money we spent on it would be in-spite of something else and i feel like i would be depriving my family of something else they need more urgently. 

ik i'm 18 but i'm still in school so don't have a job - and i was laid off at my cafe because of covid - and so i would help w money if i could, but i physically cant. 

sorry ik this is unnecessarily really long, but i guess what i'm asking is - do you think this is worth bothering other people about? is it worth going to the doctors? or is this normal and i'll just get over it eventually and i'm just being stupid.",mentalhealth,2021-01-25 09:04:06

Also, english is my second language so please excuse any mistakes.

**Background:**

I live with my family and I have a few close friends. I've never had any romantic interests. I am a graduate and earn a comfortable living. Only recently I've landed my dream job and don't feel any immediate pressure to pursue anything else. All my life till now has been one goal after another and the thrill of achieving these goals is what I enjoyed the most.

**Now:**

Sometime after getting this new job, I've observed significant changes in my behavior. I've always been an introvert but now I've become reclusive. I have become irritable and jaded. I no longer feel excited for the things I enjoyed in the past. I care for people around me but I don't feel any affection towards anyone. 

Thinking objectively, I've considered pursuing someone (anyone) romantically but I don't feel any attraction towards anyone.

Everything is just kind of okay or medium (not sure how to describe it) for me.

Recently, there have been some tensions around the house, but I no longer feel sad due to them. This was the trigger that caused me the great concern. The thought of something being wrong has caused me severe distress and concern. I can observe my thought process narrowing.

I am aware that seeking professional help is the obvious advice. However, seeking help for mental issues is ""frowned upon/taboo?"" in my community. I've tried getting help from doctors online but they're either too expensive or only do in-person consultations (or both).

Now, when I make a friend, if that friend makes another friend, and I feel like they are getting closer than they are to me, I will go, and sit on my own. I then feel like they are being horrible to me. I give people dirty looks, but I do not mean to. I thought I was giving them a blank look. I would look at people, and smile. Then I would think they are going to say something nasty to me about it, so I gave them what I thought was an expressionless look. I thought if I gave them this look, they would leave me alone. Then in class, this girl started moaning, because she had to sit next to me, so I started moaning. Then everyone started saying how stuck up I was. I never had the courage to tell people that I just really hated myself, and not them, and that I actually have no problem with sitting with them at all. I only started moaning, because she did. I did not mind sitting next to her. When I first went to high school (In England), when I was 11, I had my first crush. I told my friends, because I was trying to fit in. I did not want him to know, but they went and told him. I went and hid in the toilets. I never wanted to come out. I did eventually, because I had to. I just pretended I hated the boy. I never said anything nasty. I just would not interact with him. I thought if he spoke to me he would say, 'as if anyone could ever fancy you.' I can not inderstand why anyone would like me.

There are things that are hard for me to accept about the choices I've made, about lost friendships and lost material things. Yesterday when I posted there was something I said that I wanted to elaborate on and thats analyzing, putting into action the best plan for you, lastly get ready for set backs BUT with following those three things I have found those to work for me. Analyzing is something I do, I have to think back to times in my past and because I have a clearer mind I can better understand that I had no control, so then I ask myself ""why be upset, Isaac, why be depressed over these things of which you had no control and they happened many years ago?"" 

There's nothing you can do about the past but you can go into tomorrow with an understanding that because you had no control then you ARE NOT at fault. I have to tell myself that constantly because I find that I still blame myself for someone else's actions! Is that fair to myself? Is that fair to yourself? 

ANALYZE: My adoptive mother and I had a live in babysitter, a man who I won't name but he lived with us as well as his wife and kids, they were facing hard times in the early 90s and my adoptive mother worked for Anheuser-Busch sometimes working 10 hour shifts so it was a win win for everyone. . .except me. Wothout getting graphic and detailed I'll tell you I endured fourteen years of every type of abuse under a one roof. Needless to say the babysitter and his family were from my church and I was witness to many horrific abuses, over the years I became comfortable taking the blame for my abusers, I had to throw myself under a bus after they had already steam rolled me with a locomotive of abuse. But over the years I just had to hang to things that weren't my fault, it was not my fault another person became abusive. . .it took until my adult life that I finally had a clear view that because a man couldn't control himself he had to control others and that was the beginning of separating myself from things I could not help.

ENACTING THE PLAN: As the abused or traumatized we take the actions of others and paste them upon ourselves in hopes of a quick resolution to the events, in doing that we just hurt ourselves. Let's say you've pinpointed a spot in your life you want to begin healing from, you've evaluated but what do we need to plan? 9f course having a therapist, a network, but how DO WE DO WITHIN OURSELVES? I've done the meditation, I can't tell you how many groups I've been (still go because I love learning and teaching) what I did was find my talent of poetry and became published, I started writing about the trauma and could not stop as I wrote my poem and another and now I have hundred of unreleased poems that speak to times that I'll never get back. The poems help me heal by facing these moments in a poetic form and my victory is finishing that piece and I put it away. Now I'm not saying go out and write a nice book and become a well known writer who helps the world by writing through their pain. . .or am I? What I am saying is to try an explore a talent, get out of your comfort zone little by little, don't rush and you'll the many positive things one can do. 

SET BACK: Part of how I help people is honesty. I have to be honest and tell you that my road was not always the easy one, ( the easy way out is how we miss moments, we miss what could be, the hard way is waking up every day just to TRY but in that trying you'll be rewarded far greater than the easy way) a set back is what I call a knowledge bubble. Let's say you have been doing good with your healing, your doing things you normally wouldn't do and then. . .boom a set back. These moments are a reflection of what you've learned about yourself and how YOU handle a situation. Analyzing how you approached a situation back then should differ how you approach a situation today, a set back doesn't have to be a bad thing at all. Teach yourself how to embrace the lighter side of a set back and like me instead of having the automatic negative thought, through analyzing and planning you should be able to have a more positive approach to situations.

Lastly I want to say thank you to all you took time to read my post yesterday. I have been through many therapy sessions, groups and so on and then became a public speaker to help inspire. But seeing as we are lockdown I find that coming to Reddit helps me so if I help you then I am happy. I do wish you all a wonderful day and remember that none of you are alone, there are many light house on the coast that still need to be found and that is our mission.

What should I say?,"Hi! I am 26 years old and a female. I’ve always suffered from anxiety and depression which I take medicine for and has helped a little but I have other symptoms that I really don’t understand. This is going to be long, I’m sorry about that.

A little on my family history, my grandfather died before I was born so I didn’t know him and my dad never really talked about him. The other day I finally decided to sit my dad down and talk to him about his father’s medical history. My dad said grandpa was always depressed and had anxiety but ad he got older it got worse and he was diagnosed as having manic depressive disorder or as I later found out was bipolar disorder.

I started doing some research and I started realizing some of the symptoms are similar to what I have. My moods do change a lot. Like one minute I’ll be happy but then the next I’ll be sad and feel like screaming. Then sometimes I just feel so disconnected from everything and everyone. I feel like while I am here, I’m not really here. My energy does fluctuate a lot, one minute I’ll feel like cleaning my own room and the next I won’t.

One thing I have really noticed is my social life has suffered, it has suffered my entire life really. When I was 15 I was diagnosed with PTSD because I was bullied really badly in middle school but even then it took a lot to get me to do anything other than go to school. I used to lay in bed and just cry on a daily basis. Luckily I had a couple of great friends who never gave up on me and I am still friends with today. I’ve always had this overwhelming fear of rejection though and the tiniest things feel like rejection to me.

For example, whenever I would go on social media and saw my friends hanging out with other people without me I would feel so angry. I could never explain it, and I hated the feeling because of course my friends are going to have other friends. But the anger I would feel always took over and I would just stop talking to them or start a random fight. Luckily my friends are wonderful and I would apologize and everything was fine. 

I have very intense feelings for people that do change. My best friend is the perfect example. A couple of years ago, my best friend started getting really close with someone else and the anger I felt I couldn’t explain. It got to the point where I blocked her on all social media and blocked her phone number. A few weeks later I found I really missed her and didn’t really understand why I was angry to begin with and unblocked her. We had a long conversation and we’re fine now but I look back sometimes and feel so bad. I’m like this with the person I have a crush on too. One minute I’ll be so in love with them and then the next I’m just indifferent.

I feel like I’ve been using everything with covid as an excuse though. Before covid though, I never really felt like going out. My mom describes it as “you just stay holed up in your apartment and don’t go out.” And that is true. When my friends go out for drinks, I would always blame work and say “I’m tired from work” or “I have to work.” A friend of mine had plans that she would come over Saturday night so we could have dinner and catch up. Friday night I found myself so angry and was like “Can I not just have one weekend where I don’t do anything?” Then on Saturday morning I realized I do much most weekends. 

The only thing that I don’t relate to anymore is self harm. I haven’t had thoughts of suicide in years. The last time I had those thoughts was when I was 16 but therapy really helped in that department. I wouldn’t say that my moods drastically change my work life either. There are some days that O feel like working harder than others and days where I literally do not feel like doing anything but the bare minimum. One thing my therapist constantly has to work with me on though is focusing on everything that’s negative. I’ll stew over stuff for days. Like my stepdad doesn’t like me and I will sit for hours and just think of all the ways he has treated me since I was 13 and just bury myself in a hole. One thing my mom has said (she and I are really close) is that I focus on everything negative that has happened or why someone doesn’t like me and I will talk about it endlessly. She always tells me to get over it but for some reason I just can’t get over it. It’s not that simple for me.

I’ve always felt like every prescription I take for depression helps a little but it feels more like a bandaid on a bullet wound. I don’t know, like some symptoms I can see but I also took psychology courses in university and don’t like self diagnosing. I just don’t know how to explain this to my doctor. My doctor is great though, like he will sit and listen for as long as I need him too and never makes me feel rushed. I have an appointment coming up and really want to talk to him but I don’t know how to explain it without feeling like I’m just being dramatic.",mentalhealth,2021-01-25 09:36:42

But, if they get antidepressants, they will be banned for being a pilot forever. So I’m really lost ok what to do. They think that’s the end of the story, they just go forever unmedicated. I want there to be another option, because they are so sad and miserable all the time. They don’t talk about it too often. But when they do, they seem really really not ok. I’m scared they will try to commit suicide again. I didn’t know them in the past when they did, but it’s my greatest fear. I love them with all my heart and will forever.

Let's get straight to the point. So I was the worst student ever and 2 years ago I got very motivated and inspired by the US, started working, and went from a 2.7 GPA to 4.0. Changed my mindset and found a purpose. Recently won National English competition among 10th graders. It's been 1.7 years since I started learning English myself. I've never been so much motivated and self-disciplined as I am now. I did my research and basically, I study everything online myself(schools here are very bad in terms of getting a degree and the way they teach students). Wanted to apply to the US universities this year but I see that I'm not strong enough yet so I want to take one more year and then apply. According to USC and other schools(3 of them) If I keep maintaining a 4.0 GPA and as predicted get 30+ on the ACT I'll get 66k+ financial aid. At this moment I realized I can't miss this opportunity to get out of my 3rd world country and have a better life for myself and my family. I have a plan on how to achieve my math goals and get into universities. The problem is that my parents poor( 7000$ family yearly income) they have a mindset of a poor person. They've been struggling their whole life making money and inability to afford things that require money. My parents want me to aim at a low point and get it rather than do what I do(aim high, take risks, do my best and achieve big things). They think that I'd never become wealthy because I wasn't born in a rich family. They are afraid to take risks and dream big and want me to be the same. Every time they start arguing that I should stop it and get back on the earth, it puts me down and I feel very frustrated. I know that I'm going to achieve my most inspirational goals, I wanna make a difference and make a huge impact on the world. Tho how do I deal with my parents? I just don't wanna surround myself with this kind of people :/",mentalhealth,2021-01-25 10:12:39

Hello,

I am not sure if this is the correct place to post this, but my girlfriend and I need some help. My girlfriend knows she has some sort of mental ailment, although she hasn't been able to get a diagnosis. She has been put on waiting lists for 1+ years and had limited free sessions but didn't achieve much. Other options we have looked at are private sessions that cost around £100 an hour in our area, the main issue is we are both unemployed full-time students who can’t afford such luxuries. So here we are turning to the Reddit community in some hopes there may be some kind of answer or someone who may feel similar.

My girlfriend asked me to write this for her as she is aware of her self-sabotage, knowing she would try to play down how she is. Throughout her life she has had an unbelievable amount of trauma, from all sides, I won’t go into much detail here but she was raised in a very strict and competitive way of life, needing everything to be perfect or to face consequences. She was raised not knowing her self-worth and to always put others before herself as well constantly being criticised either directly or indirectly of her appearance and interests among other things.

As she grew into a teenager she found herself at that rebellious stage, where she wanted to go against her family’s beliefs (Christianity), and began to involve herself into more spiritual practices, finding those online who would help her and educate her. Unfortunately, these people online, who were older, groomed and manipulated her and blackmailed her in her early teens, objectifying her. Having issues of her own at home and friends who didn’t understand or seem to care, she found herself again speaking and searching for company online, again getting herself into more troubles.

Eventually, she found me online six years ago and we spoke for a few weeks, finding many interests and similarities in one another and after a few months we got together, this of course was all online as we lived in completely different countries and it wasn't until 17 months till we could meet (17 months being the time till she would be accepted into university where I live).

Being away from her usual chaotic life took much readjusting, I knew of her past, and I wanted to help her however I could. She still had many ties to her past, that being abusers, old toxic friends, but slowly she was able to cut them away.

Over these years being together we have both notice things about her, many emotional outbursts, she was diagnosed with epilepsy before us meeting, not caused by any tumours or anything, but by stress and other pressures. Recently I failed in protecting her. While being away for Christmas, she was sexually assaulted by a close relation of mine, this caused further issue which I won't go into but it did lead to her developing Bell’s palsy, a type of paralysis occurring on one side of the face, as well as bringing many buried traumas to the surface. We have spoken to health care people over the phone and they believe there may be some kind of PTSD. My partner can at times have explosive amounts of anger over little things, such as not making up our mind on what to have for dinner and other very small things that are not worth such energy. She is often very passive-aggressive with no known cause and can be easily triggered. At times she completely closes and will refuse to speak to anyone for hours and will not move from where she is sitting.

She knows she is in the wrong for these things and feels a tremendous amount of guilt afterwards and we both feel these are not normal. She has depressive episodes and an anxiety disorder that makes many things difficult for her. Are these possible symptoms for any Personality disorder or something else?

I believe she may be scared of many things, like being in a foreign country and losing me and what she has achieved being here. These last few years have been very good for her, but she is afraid she will underdeliver in her abilities like finding a job after her graduation. One of her main goals is understanding herself and getting the help she needs to live a happy life. 

Again, if anyone can help with a possible diagnosis or any step in getting help, we would appreciate that as it would go a long way for us. We are both aware that we won't be able to get help the same way we would from a registered health specialist nor will we manage to get medication prescription, but any opinion helps.

my childhood was messy - my mother attempted suicide a couple of times, she is bipolar and are generally pretty unstable. my dad is great though, but has had sooo many different girlfriends introduced to me and my brothers that eventually when i got old enough, i told him that i didn't want to meet his new girlfriends.

i used to suffer from depression and anxiety but i was never violent.

after my ex and i broke up six months ago, i feel and act different and i can't control myself.

my ex was a cheater and would threaten me at times just to ""see my reaction"" he was never violent though, but sometimes i would genuinely fear him. 

right after we broke up, i couldn't stand if anyone touched me, it was almost like touch would physically hurt me. i always used to be very affectionate. this would go on a couple of months.

now i'm better at it, but i don't enjoy physical affection with anyone anymore. (it is not a sexual thing btw)

i started to notice how angry i would get in arguments with my family, i don't even recognise myself afterwards, and i feel so shameful to lose control like that. 

i even sprained both of my hands by punching my wall - and that is something i would have never done before, i don't know why i'm suddenly like this.

i'm only writing now because i think i need help.

today me and my brother(21m) got into an argument, and he wanted me to leave his room, i continued to talk because i felt like i didn't have a chance at defending myself before he would shut me down. he threw a pillow at me really hard and started pushing me. i don't know what happened, it was like i completely lost control - i just started hitting him while screaming ""why are you getting violent"" on repeat. it was only when my mother rushed in a second later that i came to my senses. i could see how hurt he was that i would even do something like that. i am so so shameful and i don't want to be this person. 

the worst part is that my mother immediately went to comfort me instead of my brother, when it was really me that did the damage, i had to explain it to her. she's talking with him now.

im really scared of what i could potentially do if i don't get help. i had zero control. and i don't know what is happening to me. i could really use some advice right now",mentalhealth,2021-01-25 10:41:03

I've never been this lost before.","I'm a High School student in Colombia, and lately I've been feeling really out of myself. About two years ago I was diagnosed with clinical depression and spent some time going to group therapy before giving up on it. Since the Covid pandemic started, things have been going downhill really fast. There's a lot of thing I'd like to take out of my chest, so for the sake of organization I'll make a list talking about them. Hopefully somebody went through something similar and can give me a hand...

1. **What's happening right now:** In a month I will take a very important test in my country named ICFES. This is essential to enter public universities, so you can say part of my future depends on its result. The problem is that I do not feel prepared for it at all. In my school we've spent part of our academic year only studying for this test in particular, but I never took much part of it thanks to my feelings; I always felt down, tired and nothing really stayed with me for long, and when I felt with energy I spent it the wrong way. I still feel this way. Right now I am really concerned about the test and don't know what would be the best way to approach it.

2. **Depression:** As I said above, I have felt really down for some time now. I've lost all passion I had for the things I enjoyed, such as sports. The feeling of nothingness has been getting bigger over time, and I don't know what to expect from it anymore. I am currently going to therapy by myself, but feel too ashamed to talk about my feelings with my psychologist, or with anyone else. I just go there, sit and listen to whatever he says to me without thinking too much of it afterwards.

3. **Decline in social skills:** Since the beginning of preventive isolation in my country my social skills, just as my general well-being, have gone downhill really fast. I used to be able to talk to people normally, share my points of view in different topics, and generally socialize. It doesn't click in my head anymore. Even trying to talk in public Discord servers seems like a huge hassle now. I struggle with the pronunciation and constantly feel blocked while talking.

4. **Self-harm and destructive behavior:** A couple days ago I cut myself hoping that it could make me feel better. I got this idea from past personal experiences. Although it was not a pleasant experience, I've been thinking about it; if I said I didn't want to do it again I'd be lying, but I also want to avoid it as much as possible. Somehow the blood made me feel in contact with myself again. (Yes, I know how out-of-place this sound, but I could not find any other way to explain it) I also would like to add that I have not been sleeping nor eating as I should; I'm always lacking in hours of sleep and have a lot of trash food inside of me.

5. **Pure anger and deep sadness:** I'm not just struggling with sadness. Anger is with me as well. It is such an abstract sensation, so I find it terribly hard to explain, but it can be summarized to this: I get constant burst of anger, sometimes justified and other times out of nowhere, and can't seem to control it. To be honest, I don't know how I really feel about this sensation. In one hand, I hate the fact that it makes me act based on impulses, which is the complete opposite of what I think a rational human should act, but in the other hand I feel so pleased thanks to the energy it gives me, how powerful it makes me feel and how ""explosive"" it can get. Sometimes I think it is just a part of me, and that if I try to get rid of it it'll only get worse. In several occasions I felt like hurting somebody else. I haven't discussed this with anyone, but I feel it is turning into something bigger overtime.

I apologize not just for the long post, but for the multiple mistakes you may find in the redaction. I'm still trying to improve my English writing.

Having read some of the posts in here, I really feel unworthy of your attention, but nevertheless after many doubts I decided to try asking. Please let me know if this is an inappropriate subreddit to be sharing with.

I will try to briefly describe myself to the best of my ability to give some context, but obviously this is all a very skewed and self-centered perspective. I am a male, in mid twenties. I was raised with my mum and grandmother, my parents split when I was 3. I have always avoided confrontation. Lived a very closeted life, with few friends with whom I had quite distant relationships. Don't get me wrong, I can be confrontational and emotional - I have even been aggressive multiple times throughout my life, but those were very rare extreme cases. However, whenever I can, I do whatever is in my hands to avoid fighting. 

Somehow, despite my reclusive nature and very obviously flawed personality, I happen to be in an amazing relationship with an amazing girl. One of the most amazing aspects of our relationship has been the effect she has had on objectively pointing out my flaws and improving my self-awareness. I am much more aware of my deeper issues and problems that I have ever been.

I suspect she is so self-aware because of her very confrontational life and her constant fighting with her mother. This has led to her researching mental health, psychology, etc. 

To come to the most recent issue, just today after one of the fights she had with her mother, she started getting pestered by one of her mum's friends to basically be a 'better daughter'. At some point she got angry and wanted to tell her to mind her own business. She is obviously right and entitled to her peace of mind, especially from such people that just cause interference and pain. To no-one's surprise though, I do my best to try to calm her, avoid their confrontation, and this is where I do something very weird.

I told my girlfriend to stop and think, telling this person off obviously just serves to my girlfriend's desire to 'feel better' but ultimately does no good. The best course of action would be showing patience, waiting for the crisis with her mother to be resolved and then let her mother know how hurtful it was having one of her friends basically bullying my girlfriend into 'behaving'. I go on for a while with my theory and how she could theoretically enforce it even though not for one second do I believe that it's feasible.

At this moment my girlfriend pointed out something very interesting. She told me that she isn't manipulative and it's very difficult for her to behave this way.

I see how I just behaved in a manipulative way tho! However, now I am in a constant battle with myself, did I behave that way simply because I wanted to avoid her confrontation or was I genuinely being manipulative. I also see that it could be something in the middle as it doesn't have to be so black and white. The only thing I am sure of was that I was trying to help calm her down and induce some rational thinking as to push away her 'need to fight'. This is manipulative as well though, and I honestly don't know if I am just a manipulative person that has created ways to fool myself and feel better, or simply don't understand what I am doing.

To conclude, thank you so much for reading and for your time. If you reply, please do so keeping in mind that I am not looking for approval or disapproval. I just want to know whether I should be seeking further help for this particular characteristic of myself. Thank you!",mentalhealth,2021-01-25 11:13:20

But the problem is if I keep doing this, then it can really affect my future, and it can make me spiral down. But I can't turn it around since I can't do anymore, I can't give any more. 

I have talked to a professional in the past and it wasn't even clear what I was working on or if I even needed to see one. I guess the consensus is I do, so I stopped for a few months and now I'm trying again. It's just I have to wait another week. So what should I do in the meantime, other than just trying to get by and giving up on things. How much do I need to give up until I hit a level so low that people actually notice? Or is it because I'm hiding all the time-- well when I open up they're just like, well just be more confident, speak up more, talk to people more, etc. (I am really scared to be seen when I'm vulnerable, when I'm sitting in the corner, walking alone at night, those are the times if someone saw me, they would see the emotions written on my face.)

All right I don't know if any thing I'll say will make scene but I just want to rant.

For clarity my girlfriend is a faithful Catholic and I am working on becoming one, once I am confirmed we plan to get married asap.

Last night I was making virgin jokes with my friends (on discord btw), when I jokingly ask her ""well are you lol"". She responded with ""not exactly"". It felt like someone stabbed me a million times, my stomach sank as low as it could go, I truly felt like I wanted to cry. I asked what she meant by not exactly, in which she relied ""I didn't want it"". That was even worse it wasn't a dumb mistake she made, she was rapped. I felt like I was going to throw up, I was angry, sad, nervous, I felt like complete shit for bringing it up. She tried to tell me it was ok, I didn't know, and that I'd learn eventually. It only got worse when I put two and two together and realized she would have been a child, at least 15, but probably younger. I still felt terrible, I hated my self for making her think of it. I just wanted to hurt myself, cut my arm, break it even. I tired to avoid telling her how I felt but it slipped and it only made her upset. She kept saying how I deserved better, someone else who was all still pure. It only made me feel worse, there isn't a damn thing I can do, and she is making her self feel worse. I tired to tell her she was the only person I would want to share that part of my life with. Eventually she calmed down and ig realized I didn't want to break it off or anything. She said she loved me and just wanted me to be happy. She is what makes me happy, I hate my life and my self for my own reasons. She is the only reason I have any will to do anything in life.

But I still am in a bad state. My stomach is still sunk low as could be, I couldn't sleep, I could barely even eat a piece of toast this morning. I don't know who did it, how it happen, or what happen. I still feel terrible, I still want to hurt myself. I've never wanted to before but now is different. I've had suicidal thoughts but I know I'll never do it thankfully. But it's still the lowest part of my life I've ever felt. I don't want to tell her because it will only upset her. I am worried that when that time comes and we are together I could hurt her. I want to be with her, to share that experience, to be intimate personal and loving. Not what she had to go through. I can and will regard it as her first time, it will be the first time she willing did it. Even then I still am scared of hurting her. Of reminding her of what happen. I happen long before we even knew each other, obliviously there was nothing I could do, but I still wish I could. I don't want to lose her, I love her more than I loved anyone else. It's my dream to marry and have a family with her. The last thing I want to do is cause her pain, physical or emotional. I know she wants the same with me.

No matter how hard I try I can't get rid of my feelings about it. I'm scarred about what could happen. I want it but at the same time its a completely new situation. Its not her fault, I hope she doesn't ever blame herself. She didn't want and she couldn't even consent, she was too young. Her (and my) friend told me that some fuckers actually say its her fault,and she believes them. It makes me feel worse, I just want to take her away from all the shit and the world but I can't. She is the perfect person for me, and apparently I am for her. I can't focus on anything, I keep pacing, my stomach still hurts, and my emotions are absolute shit rn. I have things to but I can't do them.

I don't really know what the point of this was, I don't feel any better. I don't know if I got all my feeling out or if anything even made any scene. I don't know how many if any will actually see this.",mentalhealth,2021-01-25 11:41:07

as backround info, i am 16 year old girl who lives with her older brother and parents. my dad has always forced me to do sports as a way to keep me healthy.

about one year ago i was diagnosed with deppression. i had told my dad how much energy it takes to go to training and he understood that it gave me a lot of anxiety. he stopped pressuring me. slowly i stopped going to training at all and now i dont remember the last time i even went there. 

i feel like i have completely lost control over myself. i can not bring myself up to go to trainings anymore. yesterday me and my dad agreed we would go there together. i spent the whole day preparing myself mentally for it but ended up just laying in my bed not doing anything. 

i also might have some trouble over eating. i eat when im bored and i cant stop myself at all even if i wanted to. i eat more than i want to and i cant control it. even when i might feel full i try to eat because i feel like it. i feel so ashamed over it. for example when i come home from school i might at first just take like a bread or something small but then i just take a lot of food with me when i go to my own room and eat it there. 

money spending can also be sometimes hard for me. today i had to force myself not to buy chocolate after school like i usually do. last week i bought chocolate everyday and i can safely say that i am not proud of it.

Its been 2.5 years of only fights and arguments in my home, and my psychologist thinks I have PTSD and need EMDR therapy, but my mother doesnt allow it. My psychologist is my aunt, by the way, she is very kind. I also have severe misophonia, and I get panic attacks from noises my family makes. The last few years of my life has only been panic and stress, feeling of emptyness and i just dont want to go on like this. People told me it’d get better, but it’s only getting worse and Idk how to cope with it. I started to SH to cope with my misophonia and panic attacks. Things that used to make me happy (like playing the piano and making digital art) dont make me feel happy anymore. I have so much trouble keeping my emotions inside of me, im constantly extremely angry because of my misophonia and whenever my parents even raise their voices (they dont even have to be angry) i can get a full on panic attack.

I need help. (20/M),"Hello all. I'm a 20 year old from India. English is not my guest language, so excuse any errors. 

A little background:  My childhood was incredibly rough (mom was verbally and physically abusive and dad was a workaholic, so he was absent). I was made to feel like a burden and annoyance by my entire family. Not just my parents. I managed to live through all that somehow. 

Life has been fairly ok until high school. I was excelling in sports and academics. I was the nerdy, introverted jock. I used to bully a lot of kids too (I felt powerless in my home so I needed to take out the rage on other athletes). 

Now after high school, reality kicked in. I don't go to college as I'm doing a business course in Distance Learning mode from an English University. I also manage my dad's business. 

Now, the thing is there's not a day where I don't feel anxious, depressed or suicidal. Im suffering from severe depersonalization for around a year and 6 months (from August 2019 till now). Even though the intensity has reduced I still get panic attacks and suicidal thoughts from depersonalization. Also, I compare myself with every single male I come in contact with. I feel so ugly and worthless when I compare myself to them in terms of attractiveness.  

I have a very very very small circle of friends (2 to be precise)  because I used to bully kids in school and got into fights with almost everyone. So I technically have no one to talk to. 
And I got a girlfriend recently (met her at a cafe of all places and things moved pretty quickly). I dumped her because I could never accept love. I was always paranoid about her leaving me. The thing is, she introduced me to her mom and friends. I ruined the one good thing in my life and the regret/guilt is making me insane. I'm literally begging her to take me back and she's said she needs some time to process and think things through (which is completely fine as I broke her trust and made her feel like trash, I deserve even worse things). I'm terrified of not finding someone to fall in love with. 

I'm a very to touchy feely person as well, so the lack of physical contact and intimacy is damaging my mental health.
All of this is making me extremely suicidal. I need someone to talk to. Please I'm begging you all.  
I honestly don't know what to do with my life anymore. I just needed to let things out. Thanks for reading.",mentalhealth,2021-01-25 11:53:44

As I child I was obese, and was always made fun of for my weight. Because of this, I was never really confident in myself, and never really thought anything I dad had worth, or was even notable for that matter. Even when I would get academic achievements in school, my father never really cared or showed support. When we moved to another state, I struggled in middle school. I missed family, my close friends and it was hard to adjust. Bullying continued and my grades started to suffer because of this. As my dad is from India m, he was always big on grades and never really cared about mental health and well-being. He would further my shame of myself by comparing me to my cousins, and would constantly call me a failure...When we moved for a second time, I had to readjust to a new place again. In high school, the relation with my father basically exploded. He was more abusing, would drink more, and blame everything on me. Having to go to school every day with that on the back of my mind was hard to deal with...My weight got really bad and by my senior year I was 269 pounds. Family would still poke fun at my weight with demeaning names. This is when I developed both bulimia and eventually the developed into anorexia. I was at my lowest, but was able to still focus on school as my goal was to prove my father wrong(which was the wrong mindset.) I was able to get a 3.56 gpa, but my home life was even worse than high school. Because I started getting skinnier and skinnier, the abuse hurt even more; both mentally and physically...One day I looked in the mirror, and I didn’t notice me anymore. I looked like a shell of myself; 108 pounds from 269...When I looked at myself and cried and pleaded with god, or any soul that could hear me. I literally saw death. One night when I was sick, I was heating up, and wanted to go to the bathroom, and I struggled and collapsed on the floor...Part of my face was temporarily paralyzed and some body pets were twitching and my mom came rushing to get me water...I felt fine after drinking a lot of water but I knew I wouldn’t be able to go to the hospital bed my dad wouldn’t want to take me...I believe I had a heat stroke or something along those lines...After that day I made an oath to myself that I would go on a journey of self betterment no matter how hard it was...Because even Jesus went through the desert; by his lonesome with the temptation of the devil...Its been a little over a year, and with recovering on my own not being admitted into a hospital, I am now 170 pounds and have a new found love for my self. Your lowest moments really help bring perspective to life...No matter why we go through in life, no matter what others say about you...At the end of the day, only you know you best. Always give yourself love and hope...Hope is one thing that no one can take from you as it’s something you give yourself...Instilling positivity, love, affirmation, and hope in yourself helps with your mind and soul as an individual. Being an INFJ I realized that what made the lows really enhanced was that I am a very sensitive person and that I have a strong sense of emotions and emotional intelligence, and if you turn the negativity from your outside surroundings to positivity to your inner workings of yourself, you will be the best version of yourself. No matter what, every single one of us plays an important role in society. Everyone has a purpose...I hope this motivates others, and inspires others. If I can help be a positive contributor to society, then I can sleep at night knowing that I made a positive difference in someone else’s life, or even society; whether it’s small or big...",mentalhealth,2021-01-25 12:14:04

I've had about 10 different diagnoses in my life. Depression, BPD, non-specified personality disorder, social phobia,  acute polymorphic psychotic disorder without symptoms of schizophrenia, PTSD, ADHD... the list goes on!!

The weird thing is... I don't get diagnosed and I'm like ""Whoaaa! So that's the issue here!""... no. I google around the internet. I search for stuff. I think about what could be wrong with me. Then I have a diagnose in my head and then I get diagnosed. It has ALWAYS been that way. ALWAYS.

I WANTED to get diagnosed with BPD. I WANTED to get diagnosed with ADHD. I WANTED to get diagnosed with polymorphic psychotic disorder. I WANTED to get diagnosed with PTST.

I am very smart. I know how to present myself as a kinda medium severe case. So it's not obvious that I want to get diagnosed. I also play dumb. 

I don't know. I want to get prescribed stimulants because I feel like it could help me with my social issues and my concentration issues. Sounds like legit ADHD, right? I also didn't really lie or anything. I geniunely become those mental illnesses to a certain degree.

It just feels like I keep morphing into other mental illnesses. But what's my core issue? I have no fucking idea! :( 

Maybe I'm just freaking out right now over nothing. Possible, yea. But something is NOT RIGHT here. Honestly. Something is not right. I don't know what. It drives me crazy. It's getting worse, not better. I keep ""healing"" from my mental illnesses. I have no more PTSD symptoms, no more depression symptoms, no more psychotic symptoms, barely any BPD symptoms left... but?!?!?! I don't even know..... :(

My core issue is getting worse though. I'm so fucking isolated and alianted. I can't keep a job. I'm just lost. I just had the chance to get a completely objective diagnostic, but it didn't happen.

I have a problem. My biggest hobby is a card game that I collect and play. I spend a good deal on it and its the biggest source of enjoyment I have in my life. Its allowed me to make some great new friends and serves as an outlet and escape from the harsher parts of my life. I really love collecting and playing it. 

My problem comes when people have different expectations as to how the game should be played than I. I firmly believe in my own view of the game, as it closer matches up to that of the creators of the game. Now, having said that, I think the game is really flexible and my friends way of playing the game is completely valid, its just not for me. 

So my issue comes when they do something in the game that feels unfair. It also feels like I can't win at that point, and I just want to quit and move onto the next game. But i really lose my cool a lot of the time, it happens a lot. My friends are actually mostly fine with it, they know its just how I am, but I'd really like to get to the root of the problem and stop it from happening, its super embarrassing and the loss of control is even frightening . Its also weird that it never happens if I'm playing the game against strangers. I need a certain level of familiarity for my to be triggered this way. Its the furthest thing I want to be doing outside of the game, but i feel completely out of control when it does happen. 

Now, one solution is to find new people to play with that align with my values, but I kind of don't want to do that because I do get a long with them quite well. I do plan on expanding the number of people i play against so that I can have more experiences that I want, but we've in the middle of an pandemic and that's tough to too. 

So does anyone here have any experience with this sort of problem? Especially if you've worked through it and are better now. I'd love to hear from people to get some ideas of how i can tackle this problem. I have anxiety problems, depression and I've been diagnosed with bi polar",mentalhealth,2021-01-25 12:30:34

I'm 27, male. 

They would talk to me in my sleep and it would end up giving me nightmares and they would tell me the events in my nightmares had actually occurred the day previous. I woke up one night and i was hanging by my neck from the handle on my bedroom door to the sound of my other housemate trying to get into my room, but being unable to as they had locked the door. When I awoke i was clueless to what was going on and assumed they were trying to wake me so I pushed them away and tried to roll over and go bavk to sleep only to realise i was choking. The girl and her friend told me they were trying to stop me but i couldn't understand how they had gotten into the room or why they didn't wake me up before i tried hanging myself.

 One night a week or two after, they started to rape me while I was asleep. I woke up in the middle of it due to the pain and I was held down while they continued. They told me i was lucky my other housemate had woken up the night i described above or id be dead and no one would have known what actually happened. I've never went to the gaurds about it as I never thought I anyone would believe a lad had been raped. I keep getting flashes of both nights and now I'm worried I might make another attempt on my life in my sleep because of this. I don't want to die.

For whatever reason, I'm not able to interact normally with women. Instead of recognizing that they're a person, like me, my brain sees them first as women, and then as people.

I try to get along with them and treat them as I would anyone else, but most of the time I end up making inappropriate comments regardless. It feels like an impulse that builds up over time, and I can't fully control it. I feel like I *have to* get it out of my system even though I know it's wrong and won't receive a positive response.

This just happened with my brother's roommate yesterday. Not the first time either, I've already made strange, sexual comments towards her in the past and she hasn't taken well to those. She's given me plenty of warnings, but I just can't stop myself.

Naturally, she blocked and removed me everywhere and now I've become completely alienated from my brother and our group of friends. I'm only hurting myself with this kind of behavior, because I really like her as a friend and now she's gone. This time for good, too, I think, as she made it sound very final...

I get trapped in feelings of being abandoned or thrown away a lot, which causes me to fall into feeling really sad, or some might even call it depressed. 

All of my friends tell me, that they care for me and they are sorry for what is happening to me. The issue is, that no matter what, I always feel like they are lying to me and only using me (even tho they don't even ask for anything). Usually when someone tells me something like ""oh don't worry, you are not annoying, if you were, I would just tell you"", I start feeling like they are saying that just because it's what they ""should"" be saying, but in reality they just wish they never met me. 

Which results in me asking again, getting the same response, and falling into even deeper paranoia and into even deeper depression. Basically I get stuck in a circle.

Even when writing this I feel like I will just get ignored and no one will help me, bcs realistically you have no reason to.

But in case someone is actually reading this, please help me, I just want to trust my friends again :(",mentalhealth,2021-01-25 12:56:05

I finished an Intensive Outpatient Program (IOP) with Rogers Behavioral Health in Milwaukee, WI last Fall, but since checking out of that program my depression and anxiety have worsened. It was hard to manage that program for a few hours in the morning and then rush home to log into my stressful day job. I also had COVID at the end of the program, which interfered with being able to properly complete it. 

I'm now considering using the remainder of my annual and sick leave, and possibly FMLA, to do a residential treatment program for at least one month. Does anyone have experience with these and have any recommendations? I have United HealthCare and will try to find a program that accepts that insurance. Even with insurance, I'll probably have to pay my maximum allowable for the calendar, which is scary, but considering that I am to the point of not being able to work, I guess my mental illness has a price either way. 

My psychiatric assessment at Rogers was General Anxiety Disorder and Bipolar Type II. I also struggle with sex &amp; porn addiction, but the program I was in wasn't really suited for going into those issues. If I could find a residential treatment center that can help me work through some of those issues in conjunction with my depression and anxiety, that would be really helpful.

I am one of these people that has a reading voice.

It started a year ago where I would read stuff and it sounded in my head like someone in agonizing pain was reading it. Now it's more of a mocking voice. 
It causes me a great deal of distress and anxiety. I don't know how to even approach a clinician about it without being labeled as schizophrenic.

2020 was actually a really good year for me, I was able to avoid my suicidal thoughts for most of the year. Unfortunately now, I'm starting to notice that they're coming back. I'm really trying not to give into them. I'm treating them like intrusive thoughts for now.

I've started to notice though, that it feels good when I give in to thinking about them. Something about the experience is really comforting to me. I'm someone with really poor impulse control, if it's even the slightest bit tempting, I tend to give in. So the fact they feel good concerns me a lot. I'm not worried about acting on them, I don't think I'm there yet. For now I'm worried about dwelling on them and making them worse. I'm trying not to think them, but I find my mind wandering there more and more.

I feel like my mind is poking at my reasons for staying alive, subtly trying to unravel them. And I find myself remembering my plan that I created a few years ago, and rehearsing the details again. Why I chose a certain method over others and how I'd make it work today. Something about just giving into these thoughts, just feels good.

I know that I need help. Unfortunately I'm not in a really good position to seek out help right now. But I am working on it. Talking to a professional is my goal right now.

It's rare that I focus on one thing for longer than an hour while on my meds, on a good day.

I tried to find enjoyment in the small things and it genuinely worked for a while, but then things fell apart due to the chaotic nature of quarantine and I've never been able to re-enter that state of mind.

I just don't understand what the issue is. I want people to be proud of me, and to be proud of myself, but I rarely work to achieve that. I hate disappointing people, but I never do anything to avoid it.

I know I'll be punished for poor grades, but instead of trying to improve I just count the days until I get whatever's coming to me (typically losing my PS4). Then I just wait and wait and wait, and maybe put in the bare minimum effort to improve.

I was just yelled at by my piano teacher for doing no work during her 2 week absence and I felt like shit. She told me to do my work when I got home and I immediately knew I wasn't even gonna touch my piano.

I'm looking for some advice. My girlfriend has struggled with depression and PTSD for years now, since well before we met. Her depression is definitely getting worse over time, and at this point it's no secret that the only reason she's still alive is because her loss would devastate those she loves.

Her quality of life is on a steady downwards trend. I do everything I can to help and support her, and we have a great relationship, but her mental health is not good. 

She has had a therapist and a counselor in the past, neither of which were any help. When I suggest trying to find a new one, she insists that they won't be able to change her perspective - which I would describe as ""pessimistic nihilism"". Life isn't worth living, people are shit, the world is shit, there's no point to anything, etc. I am also unable to change her perspective, as the facts she uses to back herself up are legitimate.

She was on two different antidepressants in the past, both of which messed her up really bad - one even leading to a suicide attempt. As a result, she is not willing to try any more.

I love this girl more than anything. I plan on marrying her. It kills me to see her like this. I just don't know what to do. It just seems to be getting worse with time, and if she's unwilling to try therapy and antidepressants I don't really know what options there are left.

I’m not. 


I fantasize about dying constantly. In any different way imaginable. To the point where I’ve found myself idling by for months now.... just waiting for death to come. 


I’m young and it’s unlikely that I’ll die just by waiting for it. As I eat a rather healthy diet and consider myself to be in adequate physical health. Yet I find myself thinking, feeling, and acting as if death is just around the corner. 


While I wish death upon myself I often find that I actually would very much enjoy to live a full and happy life. 


Something inside of me just keeps bringing me back to that feeling of wanting to not exist anymore. 


You could bring it all down to past traumatic experiences and so on so forth. 


Being raped for years on end as a child, seeing my mother raped multiple times while I was growing up, being a toddler taking care of my adult mother while she had seizures or was overdosing on something, watching a woman die in my mother’s arms when I was around 5 or 6, the list of things hat plague my mind is endless..... part of me keeps saying that I deserved it all for some reason. That it’s all my fault that all of these things happened. 

It’s like I did something wrong and my whole life is punishment for it.

I'm homeschooled through an online school, and I have been homeschooled this way for 7 years. Most of it was less stressful than it is now, but I feel terrible now that I've reached the second semester of 11th grade I feel lost. My parents, mainly my mother have told me that to get into a good college, (I had initially wanted to go to MIT because I want to become a robotics engineer or software developer, but I've been discouraged based on how I've personally been handling things in highschool. Its extremely tough for me right now, so I'm planning on attending my in state college UCF), then I need to be taking courses that reflect the career field I want to enter, so I've been taking a lot of Math and Science related courses, currently I'm doing Calculus and Chemistry, along with AP Computer Science, Computer and Network Security Fundamentals (A new course made in 2020), along side US History, and English 3, all of them are Honors courses.

On top of that I am doing baseball, because my parents want me to get into college on an athletic scholarship which starts at around 3 or 4 depending on the training time, and that takes up 3 hours of the day( finishing at around 6 or 7) then I have to get home study, and after I finish I have to sleep, and get up and repeat everything (Sometimes my body is so exhausted from training I fall asleep as soon as I get home after the shower). I've been dealing with this for 4 years now and though it was hard before, its nothing like it is now. Now I'm taking these 6 courses 4 of which are really tough for me. And on top of that I haven't had any time to myself, or to relax or get to my hobbies or personal projects that I had been planning this school year (setting up my art shop, since I don't have the time for an after school job and I need money) or even just painting on my own time so I can relax.

To make things worse I've been feeling really lonely. I don't really have any friends anymore. I had met my best friends of 5 years at a school meetup in 2016(the online school holds annual meetups so students can meet each other and socialize), we lived in separate cities so we only got to see each other 2-3 times a year. And we only talked through skype. They were my only friends, I had in a long time and they left me last year so I've just been going alone since COVID-19 started. And if the loneliness wasn't torturing before it is now, considering I cant even cheer myself up by doing my hobbies.

I feel so stressed, now that the SAT's are coming up and I haven't had any time to prepare, and If I try to set time aside I will end up falling behind on my regular school work. On top of that It would be impossible to find time for myself. I just feel so alone and tired and stressed. I feel as if I'm wasting my time in highschool.

I see others on social media having fun with their friends, and living life like nothing is a problem for them.

Years of abuse and bullying and cringe. Video games are my passion and I have gotten a bachelor's in game design. 

I have run into an issue in my adult life though. I obsess over analyzing and comparing what video games are my favorite and a NEED to find a favorite. In my spare time after work I will replay the same games I love over and over in an attempt to analyze and compare. 

Some of them i'm on my 30th playthrough because I try to remove negative nostalgia too. If i have a bad memory associated with my favorite moment in a game, I will repeat the game over and over again, sometimes with music blasting, to help ""overwrite"" the memory in a way. 

Sometimes I have a gruesome or disgusting intrusive thought involving family members while playing a game, then that memory will forever be associated with the game, causing me to replay it over and over again to make sure the same memory doesn't stick. Sometimes i just get reminded of a bad memory with my father or in high school by trying to play a favorite game.

Sometimes it's just a favorite character suddenly reminds me of a person in real life that has wronged me/annoys me, then looking at that same character annoys me until I find someone else to associate the character with. 

Whenever I try to tell someone about this, they get weirded out, view me differently, or poke fun at me.... making me feel even more disgusted and alienated with myself. It makes me want to kill myself sometimes.

I played a game that was a new favorite of mine recently, but then I had a gruesome incestuous nightmare the same night I beat it. I sold the game the same morning and never touched it again. Sometimes this issue carries into real life events, couldnt even enjoy my own graduations.

I work full time, have a fiancee, have a baby on the way, i make things to sell on etsy, yet I still have this issue. Busying my mind doesnt change that my passion and favorite pastime is actively being ruined for me as i constantly get stuck in a loop of replays. No matter what I'm doing I'm trying to avoid negative thoughts or reminding myself of bad memories from college/high school.",mentalhealth,2021-01-25 14:58:44

Hello, 21F here dating 23M in USA. ****I am going to put a trigger warning here because I will talking about some touchy subjects relating to abuse/drug use/self harm/ eating disorders so please, please be wary***
A little bit of background, I grew up in a very poor toxic abusive house hold with 2 drug addicts for parents who had a boat load of kids together. With all of those crazy stories that come to mind, so does all of the trauma. By 13, I had already developed an eating disorder and self harmed frequently. 14, I started smoking cigarettes and trying out whatever drugs I could get my hands on. 15, moved out of my childhood home. 16, I dropped out of high school. Let’s just say, I’ve had my fair share of issues. Now 21, I can say I’ve turned my life around a lot, I’m on my way to get my GED and am slowly saving up for a car. I’ve been living with my boyfriend since I was 15, so he’s been around for a lot of the stuff I’ve had to deal with.
My boyfriend grew up in a very old style household as an only child with two parents who hadn’t separated until he was around 18. He had a pretty normal child hood, he hung out with the wrong kids and got in trouble in his teens but he turned his life around as well and we are both doing much better. With all of that being said, we have two very different mind sets when it comes to family. Damn, I can barely hug a sibling without it being extremely weird to the both of us. My boyfriend having grown up in a very traditional household, was never really taught about mental health. I feel as if he was taught more to be afraid of it. I don’t like to talk about how I’m feeling as much as it is but when it comes to him no matter how amazing we are together, mental health is something we do not talk about much.
Ever since moving out, I always was working crazy long hours every week busting my behind because I didn’t have financial support from anyone else. I always drowned out whatever was going on in my life with work because it just made me feel sane to walk into something normal. As of Covid ruining everything and everyone, I have been unemployed. Let’s just say, my mind has run amuck. Its jumped, hopped, skipped, it has ran away. I have never been in such a deep rut ever before. The past few months, I have been so depressed. Something as simple as showering has become such a hard task. Something that takes so little out of you, drains out all of my energy to my core just thinking about it. My boyfriend has worked throughout this entire covid debacle so you can say my actions haven’t been easy on him. He doesn’t understand that when I say I can’t get up and do a simple task it’s not because I’m lazy, it’s because I mentally cannot do it. I can feel him start to resent me for the way I’ve been acting. I can feel myself start to resent him for not getting it. He doesn’t understand. I’ve tried to make him understand and he doesn’t get it.
Going through this rut, I have tried to understand why I’m so depressed all the time and why everything is so hard. I was exploring the idea of getting checked out for ADD/ADHD because all of the symptoms match up perfectly and it would 100% make sense as to a lot of the little things I repeat everyday. It is also hereditary and I have older brother who got diagnosed with the disorder when I was very young so it would make sense if I had it and was never diagnosed as a child because symptoms can appear differently in woman compared to men. So when I was exploring this, I brought up the idea to my boyfriend of going to speak to someone about this who responded with, “if you get adderall, can I try one?” Now, before the angry comments come, he doesn’t do drugs. He hasn’t in years, it was a joke, a poor one but a joke. He didn’t understand how long if took me to tell him how I was feeling. He dismissed every single thing I was feeling in just eight words. He didn’t understand that for hours before, I sat there and thought of every single possible way I could bring up this serious conversation up to him. He didn’t understand that I didn’t even look at him when I told him, because I had tears running down my face opening up to him like that. He didn’t get it.
I have extreme anxiety when it comes to anything and everything so you can just guess the crazy things my mind has made me think of these past few months. I am constantly overthinking. If i’m not overthinking, I’m overthinking the fact I’m not currently overthinking. Not working has been even harder on my boyfriend because he thinks I’m just being lazy because I can be. And believe me I have tried to get a job. I’ve applied to more places than I can even name, I haven’t heard one thing back from anywhere. Not even a quick, “bleep you, you’re not hired”. My boyfriend constantly criticizes how “lazy” I am, or how I haven’t done anything the whole day. I don’t want to leave my house most days. But on the inside, I am screaming to get a jolt of energy to be able to go out and do fun things. It’s just not there. I sort of feel like he doesn’t notice that I am truly struggling mentally but I don’t know if that makes me the A hole or him because if he doesn’t understand then how can he be at fault here? My dream job is to work in the mental health field because I think it’s truly fascinating how the brain works and how it can create such amazing things. When it comes to movies constantly misrepresenting certain mental health disorders, I do my part very often to assure my boyfriend that most of the time it’s not reality. We watched the awful movie split together. For those of you who don’t know, it’s about a man with MPD(Multiple personality disorder) also known as DID (Dissociative identity disorder). My boyfriend left the movie feeling scared and freaked out, I left angered with how poorly they represented the disorder because I truly care about stuff like that and he does not. 
Long story short, I’m not sure if he just doesn’t understand because he doesn’t care to learn or because he just can’t",mentalhealth,2021-01-25 15:05:12

I haven't known them that long, but I considered them to be one of my closest friends, and wanted to do anything to make them feel better. I still do, but it has been consistently draining my mental health, and, after talking to some people and family that I've known much longer, I realised my friendship with Al had become incredibly toxic.

At first, it was just me pushing Al to talk to me and rely on me more. It wasn't someone else expecting me to help them or 'save' them: it was all me. And that was fine (not necessarily healthy, but I know that now).

When they told me they were suicidal, amongst many other mental health issues, I did everything in my power to be there for them, even if it meant jeopardizing my own mental health. 
I would answer messages immediately. I would stay up to ungodly hours calming Al down. I would endure their angry comments directed at me, excusing it due to how they were feeling. I encouraged them to get further help, but they weren't ready. I showed them tons of resources and did as much as I could to make them smile.

This is when things started getting really toxic, on both our parts.

When I was spending time with others, I would drop everything to answer calls, and be made to feel bad or guilty if I did not answer or tell Al that I had gone somewhere. I had woken up to many missed calls before and I felt blamed for potential suicide attempts. 
If I was shown as active online but was not responding, I was told I didn't care, and accused of not being a real friend.
I was told I was the only person who cared, and this led to me putting further pressure on myself, as I was all they had. Without me, what would happen? When people told me to stop and look after myself, I got angry at them. What if Al died? And it would be my fault, just because I wanted to sleep one night? I would happily sacrifice that one night's sleep if it meant Al would be okay. And this mentality led to little to no sleep at all, and little to no time to myself.
I felt entirely responsible for this person's actions, and began to feel anxious whenever I was on my phone or online, in case Al saw I was not responding straight away (because of my nerves about the whole situation, I would often need time to calm down). 

Eventually my other friends made me realise how unhealthy this all was, and that this actually isn't what friends are for. I took a step back. I am actually getting sleep now, and I'm trying to look after myself. We still talk and I try to help when I feel capable of it, but I am still being told it's not enough and still being indirectly accused of not caring.

The anxiety of something actually happening to Al still gets to me, and I have constant inner conflicts about whether I'm a good person and friend. I keep telling myself I'm not a therapist, and if they need help, it will have to come from them and not from me. I have given them all the resources I know of. But there's still doubt.

Am I right in prioritising myself right now? I guess I just need to hear it from other people, perhaps people who have had similar experiences to me.

TL;Dr: A close friend was relying on me a lot for help with their mental health, to the point where my own mental health suffered. Am I right in taking a step back to look after myself, even if the person is mad at me for it?",mentalhealth,2021-01-25 15:05:23

I need help","**TRIGGER WARNING: physical abuse depicted, mention of mental abuse; please lmk if this isn't allowed and I'll edit it out ;-;**  


&amp;#x200B;

Hi all, this will be a very long post, I apologize... I'm really scared to post this but here goes..  
I've had three mental breakdowns today alone and the last one being really fucking scary, I finally decided to come to Reddit to seek some kind of help or advice or just to talk to people who have it similar as me, because I really don't know what to do and I am terrified of myself and sick of my life.

I'm 22, I'll turn 23 this march. I have 6 wonderful pets: 4 male rats, a betta fish, and an 11 y.o. puppy dog. She is my everything, and the reason I still cling to life as best I can. On my best day I enjoy watching various youtube videos, talking to a friend or two who still are there for me even after everything that's happened, playing games, and calling/spending time with my partner, who isn't perfect, but neither am I, but they make me forget about all of my bs so quickly and I just feel so free.. even for a little bit.

Now for the problem. I have two parents, a mom, and a dad. My mother loves to control me, she probably views me as her item, her child and so I have to obey her and do everything she says as she says it, otherwise, I'm a failure. She has physically and mentally abused my dad too and even injured him with a knife once so she basically keeps him under her foot and he keeps telling me to just do as she says. She has abused me physically as a child up until I became an older teen and adult, now just the emotional, financial abuse remained, the control, the harassment, the stalking, the helicoptering, forcing me to do everything she wants, forcing me to wear what she wants, to talk in a tone she wants, to present how she wants, to study what she wants, you get the picture. She would also make very uncomfortable sexualizing remarks when I was still a minor, would touch my chest or butt and say how ''ripe'' I am, and still do that to this day. If I ever say it makes me uncomfortable and to please stop, she gets very aggressive and says that I'm her child and she is allowed to touch me.  
She's strangled me twice in my life, or attempted it because she was so really drunk but why else would you strangle your own child if you didn't hate them and didn't want to kill them? I still think about that to this day and have nightmares over every little thing she has done to me physically. Dad has strangled me once when drunk, on Christmas, mom strangled me one of those times after she found out I sent some nudes to my ex and she deemed it a normal and good enough punishment because I ''ruined'' the family's name and am a disgrace. After they found out the took my laptop and sat me down and forced me to look through all my nudes while they watched and commented and harassed me and after I went to bed, they got so mind-numbingly drunk, she came into my room and I pretended to be asleep, sat down on my bed, mumbled something, pet my head and leaned in to strangle me. After I realized what's going on I jumped up to get loose but she just wouldn't let go, we tumbled to the floor, I was screaming for my life, trying to get out of her grasp and she just kept holding my head down to the floor by my hair, cursing me out, screaming, calling me a prostitute and trying to force my head between her legs to ''lick'' her because if I send nudes then I'm a prostitute and I will do that too. I was too physically weak and terrified to set myself free or do anything. I was 16. After this instance, I showed my ex (I was a minor and the ex was a fucking pedo, that's a whole another story lol) some pictures of bruises on my neck and he anonymously tipped the cops off, even tho he was in an entirely different country than mine, the cops reacted and came over the next day. I was terrified, didn't know what to do, they pulled me away from my parents and I said that yes, I'm very scared and they did hurt me. We then went to court over this and I had to testify against my parents but since I was still living with them and had nowhere else to go, she kept intimidating me and told me that if I don't retract my statement, she will literally end me, try to put me into jail for ''prostitution'' because I sent some nudes because she has money, knows the law and has a good lawyer and I have nothing. I was 16, alone and so fucking terrified. So I did. I retracted the statement and then the cops kinda tried to victim-blame me?? I don't really remember, but after that my mother acted like what I got was deserved, that she's a good mother and she just pretended to act as nothing happened and like we're a big happy family. She still reminds me about it sometimes and blames it on me. I wish I had more help and support back then so I could've put her in jail, where she belongs.  
The other time was after she found out I had cut myself, she got drunk again and came over with a knife, grabbed me by my hair, and was practically dragging me on the floor by it, saying how she will gladly help me kill myself if I want it so bad.

My mental health has been really, really bad since I was around 14? Maybe even younger, but I honestly can't recall that far. I've been diagnosed as an adult with clinical depression, social anxiety disorder but my doctors also believe I have bipolar disorder, I would disagree and say borderline fits me more over the years, because I relate to all of the symptoms as well as PTSD or C-PTSD. It's been getting remarkably harder over the years to cope and to live, and no matter how many doctors I've seen or how many meds I've taken, it stays the same. I can barely take care of myself, I forget to eat, clean, keep up with personal hygiene, and any and all daily habits that should be normal to me as an adult. Even the slightest stressful event sends me into a breakdown, I cry, I scream and shout, I hit myself, I dissociate and sometimes feel delusional, out of touch with reality, like nothing is real and nothing I do matters, and I get very suicidal, similarly like today. I get these anger spells and almost blackout, I break or throw stuff, I hit myself without even feeling it and after a while I snap out of it, see what I've done, and just break down crying over it, hating myself and wanting to fix it. And it keeps getting worse.

Back in 2017 I had decided to take a gap year to decide where I wanna study, if I wanna study, maybe try working, you know, just trying to see what sticks so I can go on with my life. My mother forbade me and forced me to enroll in a uni, which I did. I got into a single one and started studying. My mental health being the way it was, I was unable to focus, had and still have no motivation, don't understand even the simplest of things, have a hard time reading text or following what's going on and so I was trying my best to learn and study while struggling all the way. I failed four exams in 2018 and had to choose between getting kicked out or taking an academic leave and trying to retake those classes, which I did. I retook them, fixed my grades, and passed the exams. But I was still living with my abusive parents and so my mother kept harassing me daily, I had no privacy or life, I was just forced to study 24/7. After one of our daily arguments, mom told me to get the fuck out of her house, and so I did. I found a flat, spent all my savings, and moved out, and after I did, she got so damn pissed that I left lol. At first didn't talk to me but later kept asking me to come back. I found a job but the flat was very expensive and shit, neighbors were violent alcoholics, tried to break into my flat once and I was just terrified, even sleep there. After three months of this and working, I started breaking down at work and just fell apart, my flat was full of trash and I just couldn't cope or care for myself anymore. Mom offered me to go back to university and in return, she will let me live in her spare flat, so I could be alone. At that moment it seemed like a perfect idea like it would save me from the shit I had. But I had forgotten how controlling and fucked up she is and that she would just control me more afterward. I got back into uni and moved into my current flat and the control and stalking ensued. Daily calls, daily messages: what are you doing? with whom? why? when? go out with me, why not? Why don't you want your mother? I've done so much for you! Constant guilt-tripping I don't want her, that she sacrificed everything for me and I ended up such shit, if she would've known, she wouldn't have tried. Even now, during a pandemic, she keeps texting me wanting to go out and I keep having to tell her its a pandemic, we have a quarantine, we shouldn't go out and I don't want to but she keeps getting pissed at me and finding these excuses that it doesn't matter, I HAVE to go. If I don't answer her call or two, she threatens to come over to my flat, demanding to know what's going on, where am I, etc. I can't have my own plans, opinions, decisions, anything.  
The most recent event I had with her when I finally went outside to the store to buy some food because I was feeling a little better and was determined to clean up and throw all the trash out etc, I come back to my flat-locked differently than I left it. I immediately knew it was my mother but tried to reassure myself that maybe it isn't and entered the flat. It was. She came over randomly and let herself in and was sitting there, furious, waiting for me. Since she saw the state of the flat, she interrogated me where I was and then screamed at me for a good 30 minutes and then brought up the fact that she found my dildo (lol I'm an adult fuck off Karen) in my closet last summer after she was rummaging through my shit yet again and so according to her, if I have a dildo I must be a whore and a prostitute and started grilling me why I had one, do I ''like'' it and where do I put it, how do I put it and why?? Just, very uncomfortable, violating, and humiliating questions. She then claimed it must've been my friend that supplied me with this dildo and do I sell illegal stuff and to stop talking to the only friend I have because she is a bad influence on me. I was 22 when this happened lol.

So, coming back to the present day, I'm daily and breaking down after each time she calls me. Most of her calls is just her wanting to chat and then yelling at me because my tone is bad and complaining about me, saying how lazy I am, how fat I am, I should do this, that, etc etc.  
I failed more exams, I'm forced to take another academic leave but my mother forbids me. I don't have a choice but she doesn't care. I can't quit uni either because I'll have to pay 1500 euro that I owe them and I have nothing. So I'm essentially stuck in here too. I can't get a job because my uni schedule is so fucked, I could only work at night but I couldn't manage that.  
All I want is a normal mother, some support, and help to get through this and so I could make my own decisions and get my life back and try to heal and be happy, but I know I can't have that either.

In an ideal world, if only I had enough money to pay off my uni so I could maybe quit and pack up my lovely pets and move out or move in with my partner and try to rebuild what I've lost, that would be perfect... I would even like to attempt uni again after I got to a hospital or get the help I need if I have the support and the money. But I have no idea how to get so much money so fast and how to function by myself.

Does anyone else have a similar story to mine? How did y'all get out of it? How did y'all deal/cope with everything? Should I attempt in making a GoFundMe or something for help, if those work? If you have any tips or resources or literally anything, I will be forever grateful to hear all of them out. And please don't report me lol, I hate cops and I can't handle any more shit aha.

Like rn my dad asked me if I wanted a pizza and I’m hungry as hell but instead of me saying straight up “yes” I said something like “I wouldn’t mind one”.

Since I am 9 Years old I am sometimes experiencing these really weird physical symptoms (mostly when I already am a little nauseous). It happened for the first time when I was 9 when I was about to puke. I was trembling and shaking, nauseous and then I finally puked. This ""experience"" kinda traumatized me and since then I am afraid to vomit (which is also a thing i don't understand vut whatever).
(This is only the background information)

From time to time I've been experiencing these physical symptoms now such as trembling and shaking, hot flashes, dizziness to a certain degree, not being able to sit still and the feeling of absolutely going insane. 

Yesterday these symptoms were extremely bad and I absolutely didn't know what was going on. So I started thinking about what these symptoms really are because I never knew how to cope with them. 
Are these symptoms a physical reaction of my body trying to prevent that ""trauma"" to happen again or is this just simply a panic attack / anxiety attack?

I really hope that someone is being able to tell me what is happening (even right now for the second day in a row) and explain it to me. I'm really sorry if this text is kind of confusing.... Please ask whatever might help me / you to figure it out somehow).

Last year my family- like others during this time- was suffering with money problems so I missed an ENTIRE YEAR of classes.  
So now that I'm doing online classes on Microsoft Teams, everything feels like it's going to hell (As if it wasn't already)

As some of the people who might have read one of my previous posts on this sub-reddit is here, you would know that my parents divorced when I was 8 and I stayed with my Dad.  
You can read my previous post for more details.

Anyway, recently my work ethic has SUFFERED to the point where I can barely finish any assignments.  
I just feel so drained all the time, but me being me, I have to play the ""I'm okay"" card because I don't want anyone getting worried.  
(My brain is in this constant state of being split between ""I desperately need help"", ""I want it to end"", ""I'm too scared to die"" and ""I don't want to be pitied"".)

So, this weeks assessment came through and was sent to both my parents. (I barely got any assignments out. I couldn't handle them all.)  
My Dad was more understanding, but it felt more like he had just given up.  
As for my Mom, she wasn't so calm about it.

My Mom is the strict one, but she's given up too.  
Considering how long and how much more emphasis was put into her lectures in the past, this one only sat at 2 minutes.

I know I'm a disappointment and they're trying not to let it show.

I can't do this anymore.

I have been diagnosed and I’m on medication. A lot of my trauma comes from my parents, who I love dearly, but they don’t accept responsibility for the trauma they have caused. One of my trigger points is talking about school. I went undiagnosed till I was 18, so school was a struggle for me especially because of the undiagnosed ADHD. I can’t remember things to save my life, add the depression and anxiety so when I do remember things, I’m stuck in bed with no motivation to do anything. 
My parents would often times use my failing in school as a reason for all their hardships. They can’t focus on work because they are so stressed, they are thinking of divorcing because me doing so poorly in school causes them to fight, and the big topper, they feel like such bad parents they want to end their lives. Both my parents also have PTSD, but they have never seen a flaw with anything they have said.
Well here lies the problem, I’m in college, and I’m doing a lot better than I ever did in high school, I have a 3.8 GPA, I was on the deans list twice, I’m trying to become a nurse. I’m doing better, but last semester wasn’t a good one. Corona Virus hit hard, and my mom works in a clinic so I would have to go long periods of time without seeing anyone, especially my boyfriend of 4 years, who has been the biggest help to me.
My boyfriend actually moved in with my family and I to escape his own unhealthy home life, and that was really stressful because we are very opposite people when it comes to how we live. Then after he moved in, my 15 yo cat’s kidney’s failed, and we had to put her down. I was an emotional wreck to say the least, and my grades fell. I had to drop classes, and I still ended up failing my class. It caused a lot of issues because my parents assumed I was falling into old habits, and that I was wasting the money given to me for college. Being ungrateful, and I was “causing fights between them again” I actually called them out for the last one which felt really good. I digress. 
Now this semester, I’m trying to get back into my schedule, but thanks to me turning 21, my parents insurance kicked me off (my parents are veterans, so I’m on tricare which covers me till I’m 25 as long as I’m in college), so I’m off my medication until my mom can figure it out and fix it. I’m her dependent, so I can’t do anything myself to fix it. I’m having a hard time focusing, I can’t sleep, I can’t motivate myself, and I missed an assignment. Which caused a stir between myself, and my boyfriend. Who is aware of the school being a trigger thing. I can’t handle talking about it, even positively.
He was trying to talk to me about it, but I shut down, and he said “I want to be able to have an adult conversation with you without you shutting down.” And since I was already far gone into myself, I snipped at him and said “I don’t want to talk about this anymore.” Before anyone worries, we did talk about it, and resolved it. 
Serious conversations are also hard for me because I fear the treatment I’ve received for years when serious conversations would happen between my parents and I. Where the aforementioned comments would be made, “You cause fights” or “We can’t function thanks to you.”

While it was resolved, I can’t stop feeling like having these triggers over such mundane topics makes me appear childish, and immature. Like all the things my parents say about me is true. I feel like a burdening weight. I see a therapist, and I’d like to think I’ve improved a lot over the years, but it just won’t leave my mind. Am I childish?

I didn’t have a childhood. When I was in my late twenties I decided to leave the religion. This decision made all my family and friends cut off contact with me. I was so much happier and started to enjoy life for a few years. I met an amazing woman had a good job and circumstances were finally letting me relax. Instated therapy and was making good strides towards healing. 

Then this last year a few horrible things happened. One I started having violent shaking episodes that would be coupled with heart palpitations. I started seeing doctors and eventually was diagnosed with severe dysautonomia. I racked up a lot of media left bills over this time as a lot of the tests I took cost a lot and there were a lot of doctors visits seeing different specialists and such. My condition is basically a mange the symptoms best I can deal, and I’m on a few  medications. 
2. Covid hit and everything became more complicated. 
3. My girlfriend and I ended our relationship. The short of it was she couldn’t handle all the stuff I was going through and it was stopping us from progressing in our life. We were sharing an apartment and decided to let the lease run out. So I needed find somewhere to live. 
4. I lost my job due to Covid 
5. I hit a deer with my car and was injured pretty bad in the accident. More hospital bills and rehab and physical therapy now added onto my existing debt. 
6. I couldn’t get a car loan to buy a new car because I had no income so I he to use my savings to get a car. 
7. I have been struggling to find a job as I am now severely limited physically and the field in worked in before is semi physically demanding. 
8.I’m running out of money from my medical debts and buying car among regular expenses. 


So basically after exhausting all my options the only choice I had was to as they put it “go crawling” back to my mother and stepfather to have a place to live. This came with requirements though. I would lube to participate in the religion while living there as well as abide by their rules. That means no drinking, secular entertainment or talking to anybody who is not also on the religion( the last one is hard enough to work around but still frustrating) among other things. They also have cats and I’m severely allergic so I’m always extra sick in the house. 


My mother blames everything bad that’s happened on the fact that I left the religion and this is my penance. 


I’m grateful that I have a roof over my head but I can the life being sucked out of me. I’m severely depressed. For the first time in my life the thought that I’d be better off dead crossed my mind. I’m no where near even considering suicide but it’s scary that the thought crossed my mind. I’ve been a fighter most of my life but idk what to do anymore. 

Anyway thanks for reading as I needed to vent. If anybody has any thoughts or advice I’d appreciate it.",mentalhealth,2021-01-25 15:56:33

It's pretty abstract, but I guess what I'm struggling with is that I sometimes have a hard time feeling a connection to other people, or to the world in general.  


I can feel affection for and interest in people, and I can feel like I know someone fairly well. Same goes for ""things"": places or pets or plants or a subject I am interested in (""the world in general""). But often I still feel like something is missing in how I approach the things and people around me, as if I'm doing something wrong and skipping a step in the way other people (in my perception) manage to connect with things around them.   


My friends can be really thoughtful and insightful, and I feel like they have this ability to connect to the world around them that I seem to lack. I feel like I'm consuming the world, rather than really engaging with it. And although I try my best to be thoughtful to my friends, and mindful of my surroundings, I still feel disconnected and like I'm missing something.  


I don't know if this question is articulated very well, but if anyone feels like they understand what I'm talking about and want to share how they cope with feelings of disconnection (or manage to maintain a feeling of connection) I'm all ears!",mentalhealth,2021-01-25 16:09:58

This made growing up really challenging for me (24F) and my sister (19F). My mom doesn't believe in therapy. Doesn't believe in doctors/medicine. Refused to accept that she was unwell or to get treatment. Because of that, we had to walk on eggshells around her and become very in tune with her moods which were always very extreme. Her anxieties and fears ruled our lives and we were hardly allowed to do anything, she yelled at us constantly, called us names, ignored us for days on end, got angry with us when we got sick, and a bunch of other stuff I could get into. Basically childhood sucked and we both got out of the house as soon as we could. Through all of that, my dad consistently enabled her behaviour, never accepted that she was unwell, lived in denial for years, and always explicitly chose her over use (going as far as to directly say to us that he would always do this and that he loved her more).

My mom's condition has deteriorated with every passing year and she has had a few scary episodes but none as bad as what happened last weekend. I live across the country from my parents/sister so I missed a bunch of calls/urgent texts from my dad in the middle of the night on Friday, and called him back as soon as I woke up Saturday morning. Here is the gist of what happened/has happened since:

My mom (who I rarely talk to so I kind of knew this but not that it was this extreme) has been getting very into religion lately. Apparently on Friday she just sort of snapped, and became convinced that she was possessed by the devil. My dad took her out for a walk (something that usually calms her down and is the one 'treatment' for her moods that she actually uses) but it didn't help. She kept going on about how she was possessed by evil and was going to physically hurt him, and in order to keep herself from harming him she jumped in front of a car. The car swerved and didn't hit her, at which point she sat in the middle of the road and began screaming and flailing. My dad had to pick her up to try and take her home but to passersby it obviously looked like he was abducting her because she was struggling so much, so it ended up causing a huge scene in the neighbourhood and my dad had to explain the situation. While he was doing this she started incoherently preaching to everyone gathered, and someone called an ambulance, which arrived and took her to the hospital.

Since she has been in the hospital she has apparently been very out of it, very confused, and angry at my dad for 'betraying her' and giving her over to the doctors who she is sure will hurt her. She refused to take medication when they tried to give it to her, basically assaulted a nurse in the struggle, and then tried to jump out of the window. She then started asking the doctors to just end it for her, and she was sedated and placed in a padded room to calm down, which she has since been released from but I haven't heard any more than that.

My sister and I have both been VERY aware of her mental health issues for our entire lives, so none of this came as a surprise and honestly we're just glad that something snapped badly enough for her to actually be forced to get help (as awful as that sounds to say). So we are pretty much fine, though I am keeping a close eye on my sister because three months ago she also attempted to end her life/was hospitalized (this caused much drama in the family because she told me and I kept it from my parents at her request. But she is on the medication now -- which caused more family drama -- and is doing much better) and I just want to make sure this doesn't trigger her in any way.

Here is the struggle though. How do I deal with my dad? Obviously I am trying to help him the best I can, and he really has been forced to very quickly come out of denial and to acknowledge a lot of stuff that he had been ignoring/enabling for years, but I'm just not sure how to proceed. It is hard for me to talk through these things with him now because I tried and tried for so long and always got shut down, and now he is the one hurt and upset and confused and ignored and I'm finding it hard to effectively comfort him because I just can't get on his level of realizing all of this for the first time. So it's hard for me to level with him and I don't want to sound too accusatory or too harsh when I'm talking to him even though I could realistically be placing a great deal of blame on him.

I can level with my sister and support her because that's what we've been doing since we were kids and we've always been on the same page, but I'm just struggling with how to behave with my dad right now. I am worried about him not only because this is the first time he's been alone in 27 years (my mom will be gone at least 6 weeks), but also because if/when she does come back -- what does that even look like? I'm worried for his safety based on what happened and I want him to realize that he has to be careful for himself, but I also don't want to again be too harsh.

This is the first time in my life that one of my parents has taken me seriously/listened to what I've had to say/treated me like a proper adult, and I'm glad that I'm able to take control of my relationship with them because that always felt impossible before because of the extent of their denial. So this situation is obviously a turning point. But I just don't really know how to be the adult/supporter/comforter/safety watcher here.

So when I was 12 or 13 I knew a girl. She sat next to me in english. Every day we'd sit next to each other (assigned seating) and every day I'd talk her out of suicide. She'd self harm almost every night. Once carving her boyfriend's name into her leg. It is the reason I remember his name. Every day she'd talk about wanting it to end and every day I talked to her telling why life was beautiful and why she should live. I was just a kid. But this girl became an important part of my life for the entire school year. She told me once no one would care if she died, and all I could say was she was wrong. I'd care. 

A few months back I smoke a bunch of weed and went down a rabbit hole and I started thinking about her. How important she used to be to my life. Just for being the quiet girl I sat next to in class. I had to look her up. Make sure she was alive. And I found out how hard it was for her in high school as I moved by then. But for some reason I want to talk to her. And I don't know why. And I'm not sure I should. Or if she'd want to talk to me. I haven't seen her since I was 14. And we weren't even friends. Other than that class I don't remember talking to her at all. It has has been 15 years. 

But today I tried. I tried to reach out. And I made contact with who I believe is her father, though he hasn't said as much. And I've tried to verify I am who I said I am and not some random stranger but the fact is at this point I kind of am and I don't know what else to do as I wait for his next reply. I don't even know if I will get another reply. But I still think I need to do this for my own mental health. I just want to hear her say she is okay. That I don't have to worry any more. I don't know. I keep being on the verge of tears at the idea and I'm not even sure why anymore.

My boyfriend is so harsh on me. Currently having a bad week/phase where I'm really down and anxious to the point I have no nails again.

Sleep is also VERY hard if I ever do sleep. I love when I feel like this but it’s also embarrassing because I can tell people look at me like I’m crazy from how ‘high’ and manic I am. It’s probably scary and intimidating.

But when I’m sad...it’s debilitating. I can’t get out of bed, it’s this empty pain that just gnaws at my soul, I think of death all the time, my problems seem like they’ll never end. I stop taking care of myself, I don’t care and my mind just keeps thinking that things will never truly end and I’ll always feel this low. I don’t eat, nothing seems fun, I want to hurt myself. I hate myself. What’s the point of going on if I keep ending up here? I sleep a lot too.It’s such a low place and I hate it.

There’s very rarely an in between and when it is I call it my static place. I’m usually very dissociative and neither happy or sad. Just there.

(19) Me and my gf of 1 and a half years have recently broke up. We are on good terms but broke up because she is moving to the other side of the world and also because she is dealing with extreme depression and being in a relationship isn’t in either of our best interests right now because of that. She would almost never do stuff with me in person because of it. I won’t waste too much of your time but she basically refuses to do anything about the depression and her severe anxiety which is all I really want, I don’t really care if she has anxiety and depression but I want her to want to get better and she has made no steps in the past couple years of her having it to get better. I have tried setting her up with appointments with therapists but she refuses. Anyhow I understand it’s in her hands for the most part but I really just want to see her happy because It’s hard to not let it ruin me. We still talk regularly but of course we only see eachother every month or so and that’s the same as with being in the relationship too. I’m wondering if I should shoot her parents a text telling them what she’s going through in the hopes of them getting her help because they know something is up with her but they aren’t informed much on mental health or any of that. She almost guaranteed will not get help otherwise so I’m wondering if this is the right decision to do or not. I’m open to any other suggestions thank you all",mentalhealth,2021-01-25 17:49:45

I’m 21M (although this happened when I was 20) and I’ve been working as a bartender on and off (thanks COVID) for the past couple years. At some point, back at the end of 2019, I had a situation where I ended up having to kick a dude out of the venue (he was being rowdy, looking for fights and was more than a little drunk) and obviously he took that about as well as you’d expect. But eventually we got him out the door and slapped him with a ban in the process. Fast forward to closing time and because it was a smaller venue, all the staff had gone home except for me and my manager that night, a woman about 28 years old, about 5’5 and 4 months pregnant at the time. We’re locking up for the night just about to go home when these two guys in black hoodies start walking up to us in the parking lot, one of them is kinda hanging back and the other one is walking pretty purposefully towards us, pretty clear he was coming over to talk to us given that it was 3am in an otherwise empty parking lot. My manager walked toward him a bit and yelled out the venue was closer for the night, cause we both assumed he was just some local drunk who wanted in, happens all the time. Anyway, he just keeps walking and as he gets closer I see the other guy behind him is looking kinda nervous like he can’t decide if he wants to be there or not. That’s when I noticed the front guy has his hands in his pocket and it’s pretty obvious he’s trying to conceal something in there. At that point I stepped in front of my manager and started yelling out to the guy asking what he was doing here. He just kept walking up and when he got within about 10 steps of me he pulled out a knife and stood there, I think he was deciding how far he actually wanted to go at that point now that he’d made it pretty clear what he was doing. He started yelling shit about how we shouldn’t have kicked him out cause he’s got biker friends and saying we’ve gotta lift the ban or he’ll cut us, all the usual drunk butthurt douchebag shit you deal with every time you ban someone. By this point my manager is already on the phone to the police and so I yell out to him that the cops are on the way and that we’ve already got photos of his ID from when he banned him earlier so he better get the fuck outta there if he didn’t feel like spending the next couple years behind bars. His friend was already halfway down the block at this point and eventually after a shitload of grandstanding and name dropping various bikers he was “friends” with (hard to buy into given the dude he ACTUALLY brought with him pissed his pants immediately), the guy finally took off and we got home without a scratch. 

Anyway, not long after that I lost that job cause of COVID and ended up being forced to move around a whole bunch pretty much all last year. I finally got stable able October and managed to find more bar work, and I found that I was a little more hesitant to kick people out or cut them off and was kinda nervous doing really late closes, found myself hurrying to get all the cleaning done each night so I could get out earlier. And now recently they’ve been cutting staff due to a second wave of COVID slowing down business, which includes cutting all the security staff unless there’s a function on that night. Now I’m just finding that I’m dreading late night shifts now (which is the bulk of my shifts) and I don’t know what to do about it. It makes me feel really weak and stupid cause it’s not like I was stabbed or anything, I should be able to shrug off a light threatening, especially since I don’t even think the guy ever intended to actually follow through. I don’t know, it’s like part of me wants to go and get in a bunch of fights just to prove to myself I’m tough enough to handle it, and part of me wants to never leave my front door now.

I probably also have a lot of residual guilt from childhood cause my dad used to be pretty violent, sometimes towards me, but mainly towards my mom and sister. I haven’t been around him since I was about 11, so it might sound stupid to say I feel weak and guilty to have not stood up to him, but I still feel that way regardless, would’ve prefer to get my ass kicked that watch other people get beaten down.

Maybe I need to leave bartending behind, but that feels like I’m letting some loser affect me more that he has any right to. That and I really can’t afford to leave the job, otherwise I would have by now cause this new venue is so poorly managed and shit that they’ve given me practically every reason under the sun to want to leave. Maybe that’s why this things seems to be coming up again now, cause I’ve got a heap of stress from other aspects of the job too but can’t leave.

It’s my first time posting. I don’t even know what I need, but like all of us I need help and the post will form as I type. (:

I do not want to make this too long, but I will start off by being honest and saying I am not diagnosed with anything. I maybe have a fear of that, that is contributed to me putting off getting help, as well as how emotional exhausting it is. As they say: is what it is.

I will not label what I’m going through yet (until diagnosed officially); I only started looking back into my emotional state when my boyfriend suggested I see someone because my emotions were like a roller coaster. I never liked researching or self-diagnosing – it was always just anxiety and depression. I did a lot of research, but I’m going to omit that – irrelevant.

I take some medication, but for my migraines. Me and Topiramate have a love/hate relationship. I’ve been on this medication since I was 18 (24 now), and my amazing PCP realized I was not just having random ‘dizzy spells’, they were migraines. Now I notice every single symptom and twitch, but then I was only noticing the biggest symptom: dizziness.

About mine and Topiramate’s love hate relationship: \[try to some this up\] a couple years ago I decided for whatever reason I did not want to take this anymore and I stopped. It was bad. Withdrawal, withdrawal, withdrawal. I tried to go back on it, didn’t stick. I went on Trokendi XR, nothing. Then back on nothing. This whole time of going on and off this same med I’m getting new side effects and just adapting to them.

I went back on Trokendi (200mg daily) in August 2020. I was having a hard time taking my evening dose of Topirmate IR. I was on Trokendi for a month. During this time, my déjà vu and impending doom was out of control. There were some synapses that were crazy firing in my brain. The biggest issue was I became delusional. I had always been anxious and paranoid, but never out right delusional. This was new for me.

After going off the medication, these feelings are still there but dull. It feels like I’m not actively feeling (the feelings) but a memory of them. I know that probably does not make sense. I feel like Trokendi messed me up big time

Anyway, I’m still holding a delusion near and dear to my heart. I am not going into the sorted details of my delusion... just yet.

I have not had a full night’s sleep since August.

I had another talk with my boyfriend this weekend. He once again has confirmed this is not happening.

I can confront my delusion and nothing. I just don’t understand where it came from, or what I need to do to get some sleep.

I guess I posted this word wall here to see, if anyone else has experienced a delusion they just can’t shake?

Lately I’ve just been thinking about admitting myself somewhere, which I have never done, but from the person accounts I read it doesn’t help.

I need help. A solution.

I can be a bit of a hypochondriac and I have diagnosed myself a lot. It’s getting to the point where I think the anxiety is creating the symptoms of everything I’m so worried about. I’ve been to the doctor and after doing blood work found some iron deficiency which made me spiral because I feel helpless and sick.

I took several online tests , all said borderline or possible autism , and many suggested adhd. All my life I've known that I'm not like other people, my interpersonal relationships constantly failing and me not achieving my goals, because I do things and interpret things differently to everyone else. My interpretation of myself was just that I am messed up in the head/a bad person/ a weirdo that should stay away from society. I've always searched for a reason why I am the way I am, desperate to understand and to stop my self hatred and find real support for people like me.

I am aware that online tests aren't real diagnoses,  its just so frustrating... no one would give me a diagnosis in school, they all just thought I was strange but never questioned further, my parents were desperate to believe I was normal and their perfect little angel, not seeing how much I was miserable not being able to fit in or understand things like everyone else. I would like to be diagnosed just so I can stop hating myself and appreciate why I do these things , not just have to admit that I'm messed up in the head.

I spoke to a doctor in England where I live, he said there's not really a process to get people diagnosed,  it's only if someone refers you like your teacher or parents, neither of those would have ever done that because my teachers always hated me , and my parents would shout at me if I even suggested I had something. 

It's so frustrating being constantly different to everyone and not understanding why, what can I do? I'll do anything to understand better

I never wanted to fail as a parent, I wanted my child ( only one at that time ) to see me as a mom that worked hard and did everything to make sure he could do better. 

But I was not :

At that time, I was in a bad marriage. I relied on him to get my son from school. Just say I had a call from school threatening to call  OCS because many times my husband would leave him at school because he was too busy being high somewhere. 

Due to me avoiding my problem and overworking to take away the pain at home. I was tired and overwhelmed. I was the master of overtime. The checks looked good though.

My reality was my son barely seen me, I could not tell you want his favorite color was. I made money but I never seem to have money.  I was at rock bottom. I was overwhelmed, tired, anxious, depressed you name it. So, I had to make some changes.

I will share three tips that changed my life forever:

1. I had to take action no one was coming to rescue me, I was tired of the pity party, and no one was going to make a change for me. 

2. I had to face some real truths about what I wanted my life to look like. Happiness meant I had to work for it. 

3. I had to line up my values with what I wanted. Noone could tell me I will respect your values, I had to actively place and act on my own values. 

So, now I am an Irresistible boss I work from home, mom of three,  and in a new beautiful relationship. I own my truths and did the work. Now I help others do the same.

Hi, as life unfolds it’s many secrets and tricks it has up its sleeves I’ve come to realise something, I have problems and I need help.
I was raised by my mother, while my father is alive and well he was absent from most of my life. They divorced when I was around 8-9 years old and my mum’s parenting style was authoritarian, for those that don’t know, it instils fear and obedience through corporal punishments while providing little to no feedback, even if you did something good, with that out the way. I’m a 22 year old male who has decided to reach for help as of last year as everything I’d know started to fall apart. Friends who I thought were friends don’t look and feel like that anymore, everyone is out to get you and people are only there to use you. I was a very outgoing person but I’ve been now reduced to a shy and quiet person with a occasional thought of am I normal? Am I mentally disabled? Am I in the spectrum? Do I have depression? ( this last one is due to me living with my mum who eventually got diagnosed with it but after suffering from it for 5 years, I was around 17-18 when I got those news) who can’t standup for himself or his beliefs, nor state what I like or dislike, a people pleaser, a pushover and above all the feel of constantly being a nuisance to others.
I don’t resort to alcohol but when I eventually get drunk, let’s say in a dinner or party, I revert to my old qualities, as if those insecurities were never there or existed before and I’ve been searching for ways (hence me looking for help) to be able to reach, not those old qualities but my new and improved ones, based on my current and old ones but I feel that there are some chains holding me down and I can’t figure out how to break them or rather, how to accept them and move forward. I know it takes time for wounds of the past to heal, especially when you are looking deep at yourself.
I know it’s the path that builds us and shapes us, I know this but I don’t know what to do exactly...
I feel scared of doing what I’d like to do and saying what I want with the effect of being kicked out of my residency or hated and scorned by the people I live with or even my friends. 

With all of this said, I’m looking for help regarding on what to do to be able to move on and become a better version of Myself

All help is appreciated. 


TL:DR: I have trust issues, low self-esteem, I’m a people pleaser and pushover who can’t standup for himself and I wanted to know of ways to get closure with myself and move on to a better me where these issues aren’t present anymore.",mentalhealth,2021-01-25 21:20:35

I was diagnosed with social anxiety about two years back, and while I usually don’t believe in pills, I am medicated and it has worked wonders. However, I think I may be experiencing some sort of anxiety that I am just now becoming aware of. I’m not sure. I just need some comfort so here I am hoping strangers could give me any insight. 

Now this relationship has always been amazing, and I have always been the “clingy” one if you’d use that word. A lot of my friends think it’s weird because i’m the guy, and I act more like the girl in the relationship. I’m not feminine, but I guess i’m more open about my emotions than many guys. Also have more of them I would say. Anyways, a lot of the time I find myself overthinking and needing reassurance. Now this has gotten better overtime, but honestly i’ve always hated myself for it. Recently, we had a deep discussion with a lot of crying because she was struggling and kind of got overwhelmed with her stress. She had a breakdown. We talked, and i’m trying to fix some things. I don’t want to be asking for reassurance, and the main thing that bothers me is when parties/football games come into play. I’ve never been one to go out to these things, although I did play soccer and loved when she came to my games. But when she goes to games/parties I get a feeling I can’t describe or explain. It’s like i’m upset and just don’t wanna talk to people but I have NO IDEA why I get this way. I’ve always hated myself so much for it. I overthink a lot and I annoy myself a lot with this too. I’m just not really sure what to do because it’s kind of getting to me. It helps to just vent, and yes, I have talked to her about it I just wanna keep as much stress from her as possible right now. She has never given me any reason not to trust her, and I do trust her, but I still seem to get into these moods when she goes places. I want her to be able to go out and do what she wants as long as she’s smart about it. What can I do to work on these things?",mentalhealth,2021-01-25 21:28:34

This happened a couple days ago. I’m going to try and recap the events as best I can. Sorry it’s so long and is messy. 

I woke up. Me, my sister, and dad went to Starbucks, everyone seemed in an okay mood. We got home and I went to my room and I guess my dad and sister had a little argument about something I’m not sure of. My sister said it wasn’t a big argument or anything but I don’t really remember. But she said that after that he went to his room and slammed the door. 

Then my sister asked me to go to the store with her, I went to ask my dad if he wanted to go. He is really obvious when he’s upset so I kept asking what was wrong and he said nothing so then me and my sister left.

 We came back from the store, but he was gone to a different store. He came back and he was drinking a can of beer and went to his room still obviously in a bad mood. My sister left to do her errands. (1*)

I was in my room and I heard loud sad music coming from my parents room. I went in there and saw my dad laying on the ground kinda breathing heavy-ish and I asked him what was wrong and stuff and he was just muttering out nothing, I asked him if he wanted something or if he wanted to lay on his bed and he said no, I thought I should just leave him  alone so I left.(2*)


I was in the kitchen playing with our cats and my dad came out and filled his cup up with alcohol again (idk maybe wine I think). (3*)


So I think that was around 3:30 or 4:30 or something like that and I just went to my room and stayed there because a little later I heard him get another drink while I was in my room. 

Then my sister got back around 5 or something, I don’t know exactly what happened but this is what my sister told me. She said she heard the sad music playing in my parents room so she went to go check on my dad. She said that she walked in and she saw my dad pick up a knife and put it to his wrists. She got mad (4*) and started yelling at him and told him she was going to call the cops, he got mad at that and started throwing things. She said he didn’t throw anything at her but in the corner she was by. At that point I was out of my room cuz I heard the throwing and yelling, my sister came out of my parents room crying and told me we had to leave. 
(only drove a couple seconds away). 

We called my mom and told her what was going on, she was on her way home from work, she said call the police if you feel you need to and she said she would try to call dad. We called but as my sister was in the middle of the call my mom called me and said not to call the cops. She said my dad said he was fine and that he could get in serious trouble at work, we got mad tho because we thought that was stupid, if he’s trying to hurt himself and throwing things and yelling then like who really cares if he gets in trouble at work. My mom said cancel the call tho. My sister tried to but I guess you can’t cancel a call like that so the police went to our house anyways. 

We weren’t there when the police showed up so I don’t know what happened but we saw them from where we were parked. 

We were waiting in the car for my mom to get home so we could grab some stuff and cuz she said she would handle it. My sister was still freaking out and was looking for hotels to stay in. 

My mom got home around 5:30 maybe. She said we could come grab stuff like 15 minutes later. My mom said he was laying down in their room so me and my sister went to pack a bag. While we were packing he came back out to the kitchen, I don’t remember what he was saying, I was trying to pack as fast as I could in my room. I think he found out we were trying to leave and he got upset, he went in my sisters room and yelled something. I think she said he said something like “you’ve been doing this for years”, I don’t know. At this point I think he’s really upset and yelling and crying. I came out and my mom asked my to dry the dog off while she tries to deal with him. 

I don’t remember what happened really but next thing I know I’m crying crouching on the ground, covering my ears, and screaming my head off. Everyone was screaming at each other I don’t know what was going on. I thought I got the dog out of the sink before I was on the floor but I guess not because my mom said she had to rush over and help him out while everyone was freaking out and he was pooping cuz he was scared too. 

Everyone was still yelling and I was trying to back away from everyone and started hyperventilating, I think my mom tried to come comfort me and my dad got more upset and said something like “it’s always about them, never about me” and he kept saying “I’m done” “I’m out”, I’m not 100% sure tho. He punched 2 holes in his door and that’s when my sister said we leave. My mom went in the room after my dad I think to pack a bag. 

I was still hyperventilating and I grabbed my stuff to leave when my dad came out again, crying and was saying to stay here with mom and that he’s going to leave. We all said no, I went outside with my stuff to put in the car and he came running out telling me to stay here with mom again. I was crying and saying no and he got in his truck and I tried to stop him I tried to stand in front of his truck so he wouldn’t leave but he sped off through the grass. We live in a gated neighborhood, he drove straight through the gate and broke it. Our house is near the main road so we heard how fast he started driving once he was out of the gate.

 I was crying on the ground, my sister was still packing her stuff and then my mom came out of the house and got in her car. I started crying harder cuz she was leaving too, but she said she was just going to try and see where dad went. 

Not even like 5 minutes later we get a call that he was in a car accident and he’s non responsive. 

So he drove through the gate, breaking it. Sped down the road, hit 5 small palm trees on the median, managed to miss a big tree in between palm trees and then crashed into 5 fence panels. He only went like 3 minutes down the road. His car is totaled. 

My sister broke down and she thought it was her fault. I don’t know what happened to me but I didn’t freak out or anything, I don’t remember if I cried or not, I was weirdly calm but I started stuttering a lot. I was trying to pick my sister and her stuff up off the floor so we could drive to my mom, I can’t drive but my sister was hysterical so I drove to the accident. We got there, police, ambulance, and what felt like half the neighborhood were already there. They didn’t let us close so we stayed in the car waiting for my mom to call and tell us what was going on. 

While we were waiting for my mom we started calling our other sister and 3 brothers that don’t live with us. It was hard to talk because I couldn’t stop stuttering but my words were like coming out slow and I couldn’t use words like “shouldn’t” or “can’t” I had to say “should not” and “cannot” like I just couldn’t say them. And it was like while I was trying to explain everything that was happening my mind would go blank and I couldn’t remember. My sister has bad anxiety too and she started throwing up, I was rubbing her back and trying and failing to comfort her. 

Nothing else really happened after that. He woke up at the hospital. Everyone was saying he’s lucky to be alive, he only has a concussion and some neck pain that we know of at the moment. One of my brothers drove down and we dumped out the alcohol we had in our house, my dad was mad about that.(5*)

 And yeah, the hospital kept my dad for 2 nights but now he’s coming home and I don’t know what to do. 

I don’t know what to say or how to feel. And that makes me feel horrible because I don’t want to try and make this about me. I feel horrible, he obviously needs some help and I want to be there for him but I don’t know how. I’m having my own mental struggles and I feel like I can’t take anymore. Everything seems like it’s piling up and I feel so bad.

 I’m a horrible person, i haven’t called him, i only texted him once. I don’t want him to come home yet. It feel like I’m just replaying parts of the night over and over again in my head. I feel uncomfortable around him, I feel scared, but I’ll feel so guilty if I say that to anyone, I feel guilty even thinking it. I am the worst person/daughter ever. I feel like I’m being dramatic cuz nothing even really happened to me and maybe I’m just selfish. I don’t know I don’t know. 

(*)
(1*)My sister said he came in her room before she left and he seemed fine to her, he asked her if she wanted speakers and was just acting normal so I thought it was weird how his mood just flipped like that)

(2*)He lays on the ground a lot, idk, sometimes me or my sisters will walk in a room and he’s just laying there and he always says nothing is wrong  and later acts like nothing happened and my mom never says anything about it either) 

(3*)I feel he makes it obvious when he drinks as well, he will put his cup down hard and put the alcohol down hard and close cabinets hard and everyone just knows he drinking. He doesn’t drink all the time or anything).

(4*) she got mad because she felt like he picked it up right when she walked in on purpose and because he’s done things in the past that make her believe he does these kinds of things on purpose)

(5*) we don’t think he’s an alcoholic but I think he was angry because he likes to collect it and it was expensive. We dumped it anyways because they said he still uses alcohol as a crutch when he’s upset)

Me and my sisters feel like he sometimes maybe fakes or just exaggerates his drinking/drunkness and we feel like he’s doing a lot of the things he does for attention because he does it like right when we walk in the room. But I don’t want to be rude and not believe him, but it’s hard to. 

I just don’t know what to do. My own mental health has been suffering for years and I don’t think I can handle that and I feel disgusted at myself because of that. I can’t do anything for anyone, I just want to get out.",mentalhealth,2021-01-25 21:33:35

Hello! I am 23 and my mom is 62 and she is on the verge of homelessness. Almost 6 years ago we got kicked out of the apartment that we lived in because my mom had been out of work. We moved in with my uncle who let us stay rent free until I got a job. I worked really hard and moved out and on my own when I was 20 and my uncle has since let my mom stay with him still rent free all of these years. Well... that is changing. He has given a hard deadline of February 1st for her to pay $500 a month or get out. 
She has $0 to her name (no savings, no retirement, nothing). She suffers with mental health issues such as depression, OCD and anxiety which are all untreated and prevent her from working (she doesn’t believe there is anything wrong with her). She refuses to take social security which would be about $900 a month because she wants to work (the same story I’ve heard for 10 years now and this rationale is likely due to the mental illness). 
She receives SNAP and healthcare through the state (PA). I’m at a loss as to what to do. She cannot stay with me because I have a roommate. The rest of my family just says they don’t know what to do for her and that she is my mother and I have to do something. 
I’m beyond stressed and constantly breaking down picturing my poor mother in a homeless shelter. I don’t know what to do. 
Is there any way I can force her to get help? She isn’t a threat to herself or others which seems to be the criteria needed, any other ways?",mentalhealth,2021-01-25 21:43:29

Basically, sometimes it feels like I live in some kind of omnipotent reality TV show. Think the Truman Show Delusion but no hidden cameras or actors, the cast, crew and audience are some kind of unseen unheard entities, directing my life in certain directions. Most of the time, it's small things in day to day life - what some would call bad luck. An example of this would be something falls over without it being touched, or catching 5 red lights in a row, or picking a line at the grocery store and suddenly it just stops moving. Any one of these happening isn't so bad, but it's usually a constant and daily stream of negativity that I can't seem to change.

Other times, it's bigger things. I won't get into details about this but it's usually very large financial, social or health-related issues that are out of my control and continue to take a toll on my mental health.

I don't remember what set off my idea of this all being some kind of simulation or television show, but I've had this thought for over a year now. Some days it's easier and I don't think about it much. Today was a tough one. It was just one thing after another, non-stop, until I caught myself rambling to myself that it's all scripted, I don't control my reality, etc. Sometimes I feel like the whole goal of this ""experiment"" is to see how much it takes to break my spirit until I guess I ""end things"" if you know what I mean. On the good days, I see myself as fighting against it, forging my own will through this crafted reality. On harder days, I think I'm just getting closer to the director's goal.

I'm sorry of this seems like rambling as well, it's tough to put into words. I've tried talking to a therapist about this, but they only very briefly touched on it before moving to something else, which only further fuels the delusion. Is she in on it? Is she allowed to talk about this? You see where it all goes.

Before, I used to keep all this to myself, and have little ""breakdowns"" in private. Recently, I've caught myself expressing this to other people accidentally by blurting out things like ""I live in a TV show"" when a series of things go wrong. I fear this will affect my relationships with other people if they hear this.

I guess what I want to ask is, does anyone else feel like this sometimes? Is there anything I can do to stop it? Again, sorry if this post doesn't belong here and if that's the case, I will remove it.",mentalhealth,2021-01-25 21:51:50

Desperation isn't pretty, but I just need someone to talk to. I live with my father and he's my rock, but he can't always be there. He just started dating someone and whenever he mentions her I want to curl up into a ball and die because I feel like even he would leave me. 

Please don't just comment on here telling me to pst you if I need to talk because you obviously know I need to talk and I know that if anyone is going to respond to this, it's because they care...But if you're going to try and help me out by being a friend, I need someone who is patient and can withstand my fear of abandonment and wanting to withdraw and isolate from society. 

Thank you. Also, I'm going to bed, so I won't be replying till after work tomorrow.",mentalhealth,2021-01-25 22:00:50

I really dunno what the key symptoms are other than “hearing voices” but I also don’t know if those voices are mental thoughts/passing ideas or do they mean real voices.

But i could’t find anything, my mind was like a blank sheet of paper, i’m starting to forget feelings i had, things i’ve done. It’s starting to worry me a bit.

Right now it’s hitting really hard. I (22M) am currently in my last semester of classes before I start my student teaching, and I keep stressing about how terrible of a teacher I am going to be. I can’t focus on my online classes because, I am thinking about a million other things. 2 weekends ago my mom was sent to the emergency room for the 3rd time in the last year, and has finally admitted that she is an alcoholic and needs rehab. This has been especially hard on my dad who just lost his dad/best friend (my grandpa) this last summer. My parents don’t have health insurance so they are paying for her hospital bills using their retirement money, while still helping me out with school. Her hospital bills are crazy expensive, which makes me feel so fucking guilty about asking for financial help. I am currently broke (with about 60,000 dollars in student loan debt), and can’t do anything besides sit in my room and think. I try to keep my mind busy, but every once in a while I get stuck and can’t even find the energy to pick my head off of my pillow. I don’t talk to anyone about this because, I hate being vulnerable and I hate when people worry about me. I’m the person who fakes their smile all day/everyday just so no one asks me anything. The only person that understood and actually gave me some comfort was my ex girlfriend from over a year ago. We ended on decent terms and still talk every once in a while, but this is something I can’t talk to her about anymore. She has a new boyfriend and seems happy. I don’t want to bother her or fuck that up. I think about her every day and all things I want to tell her. I don’t know what to do or who to talk to about this. I feel so alone right now even though I know I have family and friends who care about me. I’m not going to burden them with my problems while they are dealing with their own, but idk how much longer I can do this without breaking down completely.

It seems like nobody actually has romantic feelings for me, regardless of how much I do my best to try and be attractive. I thought this girl I liked had feelings for liked me back, and I confided in a mutual friend about how I felt, but apparently after less than a day they told my crush who is being stressed out because I'm suddenly 'more clingy'....apparently a very short text conversation a day is being clingy. I understand that when I was younger I was definitely clingy by following people around and continuing talking up until they blatantly told me to fuck off, but I've been working on that and I don't feel like I'm clingy...Anyways she's been pretty much ignoring me now, though if she doesn't leave me on read, it'll be a very short response, not always one word but still.

I don't know man, I feel like a failure when it comes to social/romantic parts of my life, and I'm just waiting for the worse parts of school to come around. I've put a lot of effort into 'learning' how to be social, I've gotten better (or more mature?) since I was younger but I still feel like I'm years behind my peers. I genuinely do everything I can to help everyone near me, but I don't feel like they would do the same for me

Of course I come with the standard 'My dad left before I was born' but surprise! My mom died when I was young and my step dad took care of me for a month before dropping me off at my aunt and uncles and 'going out for cigarettes', of course without saying anything to me. Man I hope those are some good quality cigarettes' he's trying to find because its been years. But of course, lets not tell him **both** his step dad and his real dad abandoned him, lets let him grow up thinking his step dad was his real dad and then tell him at 13, instead of telling him from the beginning, I'm sure that won't lead to any form of underlying trauma or abandonment issues.

Anyways, about a year ago, someone else who'd I'd been crushing on for a year or two blew up at me, calling me a 'Fucking creep' and 'fuck off, I'm done with your shit', with literally no signs beforehand that I was being creepy or any kind of indication that I was upsetting her. After that I guess I kind of redirected my emotions to my two female friends, asking them out on dates within a week of each other (yes, I hate myself and I feel deep shame for this, I wish I could go back and kick myself for that) Anyways, I of course ended up getting rejected by both of them, one of them got mad at me, and the other one called me really annoying, which I guess was my tipping point, I tried to talk to the one who called me annoying to see why and they just ignored me. About 2 days later, I was still really upset and my grandparents cut off the wifi in the middle of not 1, but 2 R6 games (they take 40 minutes each on the higher end) and I blew up at them and locked myself in my room while they screamed at me to get out, which I eventually did and my aunt and uncle made me go to their house (I live in a 4 way joint custody since they live next to each other) and another 2 days after that, with both of my only still semi-close friends ignoring me, me and my aunt got into a fight, why you may ask? I left my phone in my bedroom because I was too tired. **OH NO SOMEONE CALL THE COPS HES GOING TO BUY DRUGS, OR EVEN WORSE, WATCH PORN**. Anyways we get into a yelling match for a while, and then I see the bus go by (it goes by my house once then turns around to pick me up) and my aunt insists I give her my phone for a week so I 'learn the consequences of my actions' (ironically she goes to bed with her iPad, phone, and laptop). Anyways the bus comes back around after more yelling, so I try to go through the porch, but my landwhale of an aunt blocks the doorway, and the bus closes the door, so I bolt to the back door and try and run around the house, but by the time I get to the yard, its gone. So my aunt at this point is screaming 'YOU BETTER GIVE ME THAT FUCKING PHONE OR ILL TURN OFF YOUR GODDAMN DATA'. Ah yes, a calm and rational response to me falling asleep at 10pm with my phone in the same room. Anyways I'm done with her crap, and I decide to walk to school (its a 30 minute drive, I live in the middle of nowhere with bears and deer), I get about 5 minutes down the road, and she drives beside me, still swearing at me to 'Give over the goddamn phone or you'll never get it again' and I for once, let out a bit more then just yelling back and tell her to fuck off (I rarely swear to my elders unless I'm extremely angry) Anyways, rational as always, squeals ahead of me, turning into the dirt sidewalk and nearly hitting me. So to avoid that, I just jump into the ditch, because at this point I'm crying and don't care if I get hit or not, so figure she'd have to damage her car to get me. She finally squeals off, and I start walking again, so I call someone who was on the bus and ask them if they can ask the bus driver to turn around to get me while struggling to speak because I'm crying so much, they say 'lemme ask, I'll call you back' and hangs up, so I walk for 15 minutes, people who know me passing me, crying with my bag at 6:50 in the morning in the middle of nowhere. After that day I just...I fantasized about walking into the woods to never return, I feel so alone, betrayed, unwanted, useless. In class I wouldn't pay attention, I intentionally didn't hide my emotions just as a cry for help, the closest someone came to answering was a teacher telling me to pay attention. I would be lying if I said I don't hold a little bit of resentment towards them.  
There's nothing worse then needing help and knowing people are turning away on purpose

Wanna know something that's almost as bad? Being put down by your own family, who you're supposed to trust. I grew up seeing people hating their bodies, and always thought 'I'll never be that person, I'll be proud of my body and tell anyone who shames me to fuck off!' I always expected it from some stranger at school, I didn't expect to walk out of the shower shirtless and my uncle say that I have boobies (I'm male.) It doesn't help that my friend at the time said a few days later 'you have moobs'. 9 years later, I can't take my shirt off in a pool, I wear a winter hoodie in the summer, and have a panic attack in any tight clothing  
Yet another putdown was being called useless by both my uncle and my grandpa, my uncle called me useless because I 'couldn't grab the thingie by the thingie, on that side' now imagine this while lifting a very heavy garbage box, with him giving no indication of what to do except for those words. With my grandpa it was putting on a pool cover, and I again, didn't understand what he was saying, which clearly I was the dumb one for not being able to completely understand how to put a pool cover on, which is a natural skill that humans don't need any prior experience to know how to use it.

I could go downstairs and get my grandpa's gun, if it even still works and the ammo doesn't explode (with my luck it will and ill just end up disfigured/paralyzed). Or I could OD on sleeping pills, or use one of the couple of knives on my desk right now, or a Noose, but that won't help, I can't do any of that because I can't get that right either.

I'm trying to become better as a person (learning how to be social, take care of my mental health, etc) as well as make myself better looking (trimming my newly grown beard, cutting my hair, buying a leather jacket that will make me look nicer, trying to work out) but it just feels like I'm hitting a brick wall, trying to break through, but never improving, getting better, etc. Its only going to get worse as next year I'm going to move to the city to study, I won't know anyone there and none of my 'friends' will be near, and I'm shit at talking to new people because it always feels like I'm putting in all the effort to the conversation.

Anyways, most of that is just sort of background noise, except for my crush, who now seems to be ignoring me and doesn't like my back (unless as a friend) and I'm making her uncomfortable because I'm supposedly clingy (See this paragraph? I've texted her about this much a day, for maybe 2-4 days, not all at once but just in trying to have a convo) She started off seeming to want to talk to me and even texting me until 2am (where she said 'hypothetically, depending on the situation, I'd sleep with you) but then my friend told me she didn't like me and I genuinely thought, for once, someone had feelings for me, and I was over the moon for all of a few hours. Now I just feel ignored. I know she isn't the best texter and what not, but still it hurts, I'm gonna try and back off so at the very least we can continue the friendship...

A few months ago she started taking a lot more, as prescribed, and her moods have changed pretty drastically. She is more quick to get angry or react. And she goes off on tangents about things. As well as seems more presumptuous, almost paranoid. She has lost 20 pounds in the last few months, and knows it, and is aware that’s not healthy for her. But when I mention her adderal usage or that it may be affecting her mental state, she doesn’t believe it’s an issue. It is very clearly affecting her. She is super speedy and way more talkative than usual. As well as more stressed. And the thing is that she seems completely oblivious to it. I am really concerned but I don’t know what to do. She doesn’t like being given advice , but especially not now when she is more reactive and hyper. We have been having so many more fights and relationship issues but when I even hint that maybe the adderal is too high a dose she either ignores that I said it or I can see it boiling under the surface that she does not agree and is about to get really mad. I think the only reason she hasn’t made a scene about it is because it would reinforce my point. I’m afraid to even mention it anymore at this point, but I am really concerned. I don’t have much experience with adderal or any stimulants really. So I’m wondering, is this normal for adderal users? Does any of this sound like someone who is taking too much adderal?

My mother says; People who are gay (Or whatever orientation.) usually come from broken homes/families, they are usually damaged, or sick in the head.

I have thought about this a lot recently, it honestly makes me feel terrible about myself. I was a good Christian, a role model to everyone, a dedicated believer and optimist. Now I don't think I believe in God, and I am questioning myself thoroughly in terms of my orientation. I have so many doubts about it, and when my mother even saw a hint that I may like people other than men, she sat me down, told me she would rather die than have me become 'that.'

I feel like I'm suffocating, My other family members have, well, come out to me, and I have supported them to the best of my ability, and I try to convey that I will NEVER shun them. I honestly hate my downward spiral, I feel like I'm stuck in a hole, I very much doubt my family would ever accept me. 

If I figure out these feelings and they go the unwanted way, am I a broken individual?  Am I somehow a defective product because of this? I used to believe a long time ago that things like this were a choice, but if I could, I would cast these feelings aside, feed them to the wolves. I  feel so sad over it lately, I just want room to breathe, but I can't even pretend to be optimistic anymore in front of my family.

If I move away in the future, I hope that I can live in peace, away from religion, drama, and the suffocating atmosphere.  I'm drawing a blank on what to do here, I feel so helpless and trapped, I feel that even having feelings relating to love are forbidden, it's a sin to think about certain things. Everything feels forbidden, I don't even want to bring up relationships in anyway, I just think that everyone's attitude is just slowly wearing me down in more ways than one.",mentalhealth,2021-01-25 22:35:33

I want to allow myself to feel things, but I don’t have a reason to and my mom will just get annoyed by this. I’m 18, I feel like I’m under a lot of pressure when I’m not, and I know there’s something wrong with me, but I don’t know what and I don’t want to know what it is. I’m sorry for ranting, I’ll probably delete this in the morning, but I just needed to let myself feel my emotions, even if I don’t know why I feel them.",mentalhealth,2021-01-25 22:47:18

SO, ever since COVID began to slow all of our lives down and force us to connect with ourselves in new ways. I seem to have fallen back into some old habits. In March 2020 (27M) at the time was going through a really tough time. He and his girlfriend were going through it, he was sick of his job and he lives in our mom's basement. He called me one day and began to tell me everything he has been going through and how I am an asshole for basically not tending to our relationship and being there for him. He ended by telling me how I don't know myself and that I use women as a means to keep myself comfortable. Shortly, a few weeks after that I came home late and he began asking me crazy questions about me being buried next to my family members, whether I was thinking about suicide, and basically forced me to listen to all these things when I had done nothing to provoke any of it. I felt truly attacked and ended up heading over to my ex-girlfriend's house (it's complicated) to get away from his manic episode. 

So, over this next summer of COVID along with other things, I began to feel complacent. I didn't want to be there but I felt this was the safest place to be while my brother was dealing with his manic episodes. I stayed about 5 months at my ex-girlfriend's house and didn't like much of the time there. Before the COVID lockdown, I was training really hard to play basketball or maybe start a career in personal training. I was happy. I was working and continuing to find and feel myself out. 

Fast forward to when my ex's lease was up I was in search of an apartment to try to move in by myself. I had a good amount of money in the bank that I would have been able to pay the whole lease with. I ended up not getting accepted to any apartments because I couldn't provide pay stubs and ended up back home in August 2020. This is when a lot of my symptoms started. When I first came back I did not want to even see my brother. Did he know what kind of trauma that reawakened in me? Or how hard it would be to share the basement with him after that? He didn't even seem to care and apologized for whatever ""we were arguing about"". When it was really just him projecting all his anger and taking out everything on me. It made me feel like shit because this has been a common theme especially in my childhood and he's always been given a pass. He's done things like pushing me down the stairs, punching me when he's mad, and just attack me when he had a problem with how I was acting. I feel like I've always been the one whose feelings that were told didn't matter. And it's horse shit. So, I moved back home and the first two weeks I was barricading the door so he couldn't come in. My brain did a lot of disassociating at the time and I began to be very spaced out and distant to myself. I stopped going to play basketball because I just felt like I wanted to get back into training before I started playing basketball again.

 This began a time where I was basically waking up and being at home all day. Everything has lost its flair and I just feel uninterested. I've developed really bad social anxiety even with my family. The only person I don't have the anxiety with is my ex-girlfriend that I was living with for 5 months which has caused me to be very codependent with her. Although I do love her it's clearly not healthy for me because I feel uncomfortable around anyone but her. I feel crippled by the anxiety and sometimes blank-mindedness I feel around other people and I don't know what to do about it.  Does anyone have any tips to break the cycle of codependence? And any tips to deal with family trauma because I don't wanna hold this resentment towards my brother for not understanding in a manic state the damage he inflicted to me.",mentalhealth,2021-01-25 22:59:22

Just a little background on myself in case anyone knows of a book that might work especially well for me: Growing up, we weren't allowed to express emotion and we weren't validated. Because of this, I hold myself to an impossibly high standard. Actually, it's a double standard. I'm on disability but I work part time in direct care; helping clients with special needs develop life skills an have a better life overall. I love my clients and think the world of them. When it comes to me though, I hold myself to an impossibly high standard I will never meet. 

I have Schizoaffective Disorder and chronic pain and chances are I'll never be able to work full time. I'm trying to learn to be easier on myself, accept myself and give myself the emotional wherewithal I need to improve the parts of my life that I can improve. In essence, be able to do for myself what I already gladly do for my clients. I'm in therapy with a great therapist but I can't see her often. She recommended I try a book or two.

Context: 17 year old male, have been vaping for about 5 months, and really enjoyed the feeling a good buzz gives me. I vape a lot: whenever I'm driving, spare moments between classes, with friends that vape, at night before I try to sleep, etc.
I've started to realize that I'm gaining an addiction and know I should stop, but it's so satisfying for me at first,  even without a buzz. I've spent a pretty sum on vapes, probably between 200-300 in the last 5 months, and I don't make a lot of money anyways.
To get to the point, I've been having a lot of anxiety about my future, and my mental health hasn't been the best. I've been using vaping (especially at night) as a way to try and escape that for even a moment, but nothing can take all my worries away and it drives me insane. Maybe I'm just depressed, but I've had a lot of trouble with my mental health in the past including anorexia, and nothing helps me escape it all. Even if I wake up feeling ok, I end up at night with so many feelings of hopelessness, regret, and depression.
I know I should probably break my addiction, and fix my other issues, but every time I get ready to do just that, my natural response is to seek short-term relief, either by goin to the vape shop, playing games, putting off assignments even if they're late, etc.
I don't know what the fuck is wrong with me, why I just can't bring myself to break the cycle of despair I bring myself to every night. Does anyone have some advice they can offer? Please?",mentalhealth,2021-01-25 23:30:49

Hi my name is Willy, 32 year old male, unemployed. Not a suicide/self harm risk so am happy to hear realistic outcomes for my condition(s).

Diagnosed Conditions:

- Adolescent Epilepsy (have grown out of it - no seizures since 8 years old.

- ADHD (diagnosed at age 23)

- Generalised Anxiety Disorder

- Chronic Fatigue (not diagnosed, suspected but  notoriously hard to diagnose).

I was put on Citalopram at age 19 after a series of anxiety attacks. No psychological diagnosis or therapy just prescribed by a very prescription happy GP. Was on that for around 6 years until an episode of depression/anxiety. Went back to the same GP (regrettably) and he prescribed me Venlafaxine. 

Stayed on Venlafaxine until 2018 when I went to a different GP to come off it. I was attempting to understand my fatigue issues and thought medication may be the problem.

GP told me to wean off via guidelines that doctors are given. Later found out that this is far too fast, and can often do more harm than good.  After coming off over a two month period, I began to experience extreme episodes of derealisation and depersonalisation. I never experienced this before so I went back to my GP. Was referred to a psychiatrist.

Psychiatrist prescribed me Prozac and a low dose antipsychotic (risperidone). Had extremely bad reactions to the drugs. Slept maybe two hours a night over a 3 week period. Felt like I was going crazy. Despite this reaction Psychiatrist said that it would get worse before it got better. Got a lot worse. Developed Akathisia and began to experience intense suicidal ideation.

Stopped listening to psychiatrist and family and followed my gut. Came off the drugs and thankfully Akathisia faded. This caused a massive amount of distrust to grow for mental health professionals and health professionals alike.

Since this episode I have had to stop working (a low stress minimum wage job) as my stress tolerance is paper thin. Ie a simple task like going to the hardware store is difficult. 

I am constantly over stimulated by day to day tasks. Exercise has a paradoxical effect and leaves me stressed and burnt out. Walking and basic tasks are the same. 

I will never touch medication again, Akathisia is more terrifying than anything I could ever imagine. It’s like living in a nightmare. I would never wish it on anyone. 

Please don’t recommend medication.

I feel like my brain is permanently scarred from these drugs, so talk therapy has had little effect on my ability to deal with stress. I’ve tried diets, meditation, yoga, gradual increase in exposure to exercise and daily activities. Nothing improves my situation.

I’m genuinely curious as to what realistic recourse I have.

If you know anything outside of what I have already explained I would love it hear it. I am skeptical but will listen.

Thank you.",mentalhealth,2021-01-25 23:44:43

I don’t know where to start. My family has always been kind of broken. My mother is really abusive and I know there is nothing I can do about it. Right after I was born my mother gave me to my grandparents in Ghana to look after me. My brother was there with me too. I don’t really remember much about that time but I know that there was a nanny that looked after me. At the age of 4 my mother came to Ghana and brought me and back with her to Germany because my brother got diabetes. 

After that I lived with my mother and my stepdad ( let’s call him stepdad number 2) in a house in a small village in Germany for two years. I don’t remember a lot about that time either but I remember that my mother would always beat me and my brother when we refused to call him father. She would literally force us to pretend like he’s our real father. I remember clearly when it was holidays for example Christmas my mother would give me to one of her friends to look after me so I can spend Christmas with them. I would be spending Christmas at a strangers house while they were spending Christmas together and having a good time and as soon as I got home and asked her if Santa got me anything she would tell me that he was there but because I wasn’t there I didn’t get anything.

 After those two years my mother let a german Foster mother look after me for 7 years. My mother moved without stepdad number two to a far away City (like 6 hours away) to work and stepdad number two was still in the small village taking care of my brother. Btw besides my brother who is 10 years older then me I have three sisters. One is 22 years older then me the other ones are twins and are 20 years older then me. Living with my foster mother was kind of okay. I visited my mother every other school break. My Forster mother was an elderly woman so it’s basically common knowledge that she was kind of racist and the whole family was kind of racist besides her husband he was the nicest person. But I think you can imagine getting called all types of racist jokes all the time. Not that but my elementary school was racist as well. My first grade teacher was trying to force me into a school for children with special needs or a learning disability, which she did with all non german students, until my siblings came to school and exposed her racism. After that the school was trying to proof how not racist they are but that’s another story. After that I got into a different class our my new teacher was a literally tyrant. That teacher would literally scream at students, beat then take their backpack and empty it out the window. There was even a new student who was bullied at his old school this teacher literally encouraged everyone to keep bullying him. I heard that he got kickoff the school but I’m not sure. But elementary school was really terrible especially on school events when everyone showed up with their family and I was all alone. 

After elementary school was over and I got into fifth grade my mother got into a big fight with my foster mother over money which caused her to kick me out without a warning. Because of that I was forced to live with stepdad number 2 and my brother. What I haven’t mentioned stepdad number two was back then 80 something and now he’s 90 something. My old Forster mother started to trash talk my family and I for no reason. I should have mentioned earlier that my Forster mother was a big tattletale she could talk shit about anyone. She didn’t care if it was true or not she just loved to talk trash for no reason. One time when my brother was 16 or something she went up to his girlfriends parents to talk trash about him even though she didn’t know him, his girlfriend or her parents at all. She did all that just to talk trash. She even called all of my best friends house &amp; parents to talk trash but they hung up on her. She even screamed at my best friends mom because she didn’t want her to hang out with me. And months later she showed up at my bus stop before school and asked me why I was ignoring her. But after a few moths she started to leave me alone. 

Living with my stepdad and my brother was where my mental health started to decline it was bad or anything but it wasn’t great either. My brother was never at home. He was always on the run or with his girlfriend. My stepdad and I didn’t like each other at all he was constantly screaming at me and I was constantly screaming at him. He was rude to my friends and was a flat out mean spirited person but he got better after time and I slowly started to get used to it. I mean it’s understandable that he’s mean spirited. He lived alone there in his big house where he was trying to live with my mother and she isn’t even there and is always making wrong promises about coming back soon. I was only there for a year until my mother told me to switch schools and move to my oldest sister house. My stepdad was crying about me leaving but my cousin called my mother really angry and asked how my mother would let me live with this elderly old man who could rape me any time. But my cousin was right. 

After that I moved in with my sister and her family. My sister has two sons. One is two years older then me the other one was two years younger then me. Living with her was still okay. Living there felt like I was a parasite. Her husband hated me and he made sure to let me know by constantly insulting me and making me feel unwanted. My sister obviously didn’t want me there either she would always scream at me about how it was my fault that she has high blood pressure because I’m stressing her out so much and about how happy she is that she’s going to kick me out. They were doing family activities without me or cuddle together as a family and I wasn’t invited. Or when they had a Christmas baking at other relatives houses and didn’t invite me because I didn’t belong to the family. The new school was terrible too. I literally had no friends at all. They were all really mean and ignored me for no reason for the fist year at that school. I started making friends in other classes so I wouldn’t be alone all the time. It took me months to make new friends in my class and I only befriended her because she was bullied by other girls in class because they thought her boyfriend was to handsome for her. After that year I spent my summer break at one of the twins houses let’s call her (Twin A) and went on a holiday with them. It was the first time I went on a family holiday and it was really nice. I really felt welcomed and my sister talked about having me live with her and how great it would be if I lived with her. But the most important thing that I remembered about this trip with them is that my sister when my sister accidentally said that Twin B was her favorite sibling and apologized right after and said that she loved me too. I know this sounds stupid but as a 13 year old this made me really happy. This was the first time anybody ever told me that they loved me. After that I was really excited to live with Twin A but shortly after I realized that that wasn’t going to happen. I heard my oldest sibling say on the phone that it wasn’t their job to take care of me that my mother is supposed to take care of me and that my sister should not take care of me. After that I started living with my stepdad again. After that I started living with my stepdad again. I didn’t see my siblings a lot after I moved back with my stepdad. I only saw them once a year on Christmas (when they remembered to invite me. Which they forgot really often but not as much they forget to invite me to family activity or birthdays. Or when they forget to call me on my birthday). 

After that my life basically went downhill. Living with my stepdad father again was terrible. He was depressed and constantly was constantly venting to me about how terrible his life is and how he didn’t imagine to die like this. When I wanted to spend New Years with my friends he would always make me feel bad for it and tell say “how could you leave me alone.” My brother was barely there. Then he started making sexual advances at me. He constantly kissed me and told me I could hang out with my friends if I kissed him. But when I got older and realized it was not okay I started to say no and he stayed away but he still looked and me with those disgusting eyes. He still constantly asks me inappropriate things but I stayed away. I haven’t told that anyone. Spending school breaks with my mother was terrible too. She would constantly beat the crap out of me and insult me. And she constantly brought disgusting men home. One of those men sexually harassed me and I told her but she laughed at me and didn’t believe me. After that I started to look for excuses why I couldn’t visit her such as work, internships, school, exams and more. One time my mother decided to spend Christmas at home and it was by far the worst Christmas ever. My brother broke up with his girlfriend of 10 years and started a new relationship with a woman who was 10 years older then him and my mother was furious. My brother wanted to introduce is girlfriend to us because she wanted to get to know her but my mother lost it and ruined everything. After that my brother left my my mother was still insulting him and I defended him and told her that her behavior was wrong. She started beating be and attacked me with scissors and cut my hair off. She also told me that I ruined her life and because of me stepdad number 1 killed himself. I told my siblings what she told me and they said that it wasn’t my fault and told me the whole story.

Way back before I was even born my siblings had another stepdad. Btw each of my siblings besides the twins have a different dad. He was taking care of my siblings the same way my stepdad was taking care of me while my mother was doing her own thing somewhere else. He was like a real father to my siblings especially to my brother. My mother made him sign me and my brothers birth certificate even though he was obviously not our father. And she made him adopt all of my other siblings. She was barely there and took all of his money. And when my father came around she basically made him sleep on the couch while she was in mad with my father. After that she had me to keep my father but still had stepdad 1 sign the birth certificate. It wasn’t long until she kicked him out the house and when my siblings where trying to go see him she lost it and beat them up. A few moths later he jumped in front of a train. But for some reason my mother was trying to tell me he killed himself because I turned out to be fully black to lightskin. After he died my mother blamed my siblings for his death and beat them really bad. It was so mad my three oldest siblings ran off and my brother begged my grandparents to move back to Ghana. 

Through all these years I started to gain weight drastically. And I stopped going regularly to school and my grades really dropped. My all of my siblings besides my oldest because she was a little but plus size too started to harass me because of my weight gain and my brother started to constantly bully me because my room wasn’t tidy. My grades were so bad that my teacher wanted to talk to my parents. 

Before I tell you how it went on I have to explain something about my friends back then. My best friends where the same four girls who were friends with me in elementary school because I kind of kept us together even though we weren’t in the same school. But in my school I was friends with people from other classes and I was actually cool with everyone in my class but I was only best friends with two of them. One switched schools because she was bullied at her old one but she was friends with everyone especially me and the other one was basically bullied in her friends group so we got her out of him and I was really best friends with her. She was shy but I was trying to bust up her confidence and I was trying to help her be more friends with people on school by getting Facebook. For some reason she stared gaining thousands of Facebook friends trough Facebook groups and thousands of like so peat school started to talk bad about her and I warned her how it wasn’t healthy for her and that people are talking about her and the Facebook popularity wasn’t real life. I wasn’t in school for a few days when I suddenly stared to get treats by all of my classmates. They were insulting me and were mad at me and I had no idea why. I found out that my so called best friend started to talk trash about me in the whole class which caused everyone to be mad at me and everybody stopped talking to me. She did all that to gain popularity from girls who didn’t even like her. And after her 15 minutes of fame were over and the other friend apologized for treating me badly she started to tell everyone that I hit her to get the attention again. But then when nobody cared anymore about her crap and she realized that no one liked her anymore she tried kissing up on me again but I cut her off. I actually stopped talking to everybody in my class besides the boys. I just couldn’t believe that they would back stab me that easily just because somebody lied about me. After that I had a really hard time to make friends because I didn’t trust anybody anymore. 

Because my grades where so bad and I stopped going to school. I had to stay longer in school with everybody else and couldn’t start training for a job. Because I didn’t want to spend the summer break with my mother I signed myself up with the help of my sister for a treatment place ( I don’t know what’s it called in English) to lose weight. I wasn’t overly obese or anything but I was plus size. The place wasn’t only there to lose weight but it was also there for people with psychological problems. I met there gate friend who I could talk to about anything they understood me and I was really happy there. 

When I got back home my mother refused to talk to me because I only lost 10 kg. But school was going great I was starting to do sports again and had really good grades because I was focused again. I still wasn’t friends with my classmates because I still hated them for backstabbing me and the friends that I had in other classes weren’t there anymore because they started to work but life was going good. My friend from the other class convinced me to talk to my other classmates again so I wouldn’t be alone so I did. But I cut them all off right after I graduated. 

My grades where so good that my teacher convinced me to keep doing school so I can go to university. And I did but after graduating I got back into the old rut with my depressed stepdad and abusive mother. I started gaining weight again and started to procrastinate. My stepdad got weak and I had to take care of him while going to school and working.

One thing happened I haven’t told that anyone either but once my stepdad was having a depressed day and was crying about how terrible live is. I was trying to cheer him up but then he tried getting close to me in a disgusting way. And I left and went to bed. He went to his bed straight after in the middle of the night he fell on the floor. I heard how he fell on the floor and called many name multiple times because he couldn’t get up by himself but I was so mad that I plugged my headphones in and went to sleep until the next morning where I realized that he was bleed on the head when he fell. I called the ambulance straight after and he almost stopped breathing because I was being petty. I still can’t forgive myself for that.

I started to stop cleaning my house and staying home most of the time. And even if I wanted to go out I couldn’t because there was always the possibility that something could happen to my stepdad. He wasn’t even eating when I wasn’t there and he forgot somethings. And my siblings only blamed me if something wasn’t going right. 
The relationship with my siblings went really downhill. I barely had any relationship with them but the twins were constantly bullying me because of my weight and told me how no one is going to love me in future and how I’m going to die alone if I don’t lose weight and how I could just kill myself if cared that little about my life. My brother was saying to how I’m not going to find a job when I’m overweight because I not going to fit into a work team because they don’t want anyone overweight. I mean I was used to my mother calling me unloveable and ugly and everything but my siblings were even worst. Once at the birthday of my 4 year old nephew my brother brought a picture of my room out and told everybody how nasty and dirty I am. And the whole family started talking town on my until I cried and locked myself up in the toilet. 

After that I stopped talking to my family for a year until twin A got pregnant and I congratulated her. I stopped showing up on family events because I was scared that they would all talk down on me I even started to spend Christmas with my other friends. 

My stepdads health got so bad that my mother had to come back and take care of him. She started to let her frustrations out on me. One time my stepdad made one of those disgusting advances again he said „can I lick your p****“ and I was so disgusted that I decided to tell my mother and she told me to wait until he dies.

On my birthday which she forgot she got early in my room to tell me to go shopping for her and I told her hat I couldn’t because I had school and when I got home she refused to give me food because I didn’t go shopping for her. And told her that I couldn’t believe that she would treat me like this on my birthday she told me:“I don’t give a **** that it’s your birthday.“ and then she kicked me out the house. My friend picked me up but he made the day even worst by telling me how dependent I am from my mother and how I should be more independent and finally finish my driver’s license knowing well that I have to pay everything myself and that he got everything payed for him. ( he was probably in a bad mood because of his homophobic family and the pressure his family puts on him to have better grades. Sometimes he leaves his anger out on me but at this moments it was uncalled for)


And now I am a university student but can’t study, I lay depressed in bed 24/7. barely move out of bed. Only when I have to go to the bathroom and sometimes to eat. And all the money I had saved up to move out is gone because of COVID my mother wasn’t able to work and buy food for my stepdad and her so I had to give her something.

I don’t know what I’m supposed to do I can’t get anything done. I literally have problems with leaving the house so I mostly order food. I’m literally in bed all day and I don’t know what to do. I don’t know how to motivate myself to stand up. My mother and my stepdad aren’t here I’m most of the time alone in this house. And I don’t know what to do.",mentalhealth,2021-01-25 23:49:11

I went back today to look at old messages, photos, etc. Ik ik, Why do that to yourself. Well, today I also came to terms with the fact I have trauma from many things, not just one big incident. 

It got me in the mood to just be curious but testing the limits.

I understand its not my fault nor should I feel guilt about how my parental figures were perhaps too influential in terms of opinions on one another; they projected lots onto me, but my father was never pushy. He answered my questions how he could and moved on, my mom however demonized the man.

Now he is dead, and I regret ignoring him for weeks/days... sometimes even more than a month. I wish I had showed him my love more, instead of keeping to myself and hiding from him.

He wanted to be with me so bad, and I just didn’t give back the same care and appreciation. He is the reason I love so many of my hobbies rn. He gave me Nintendo DS’, art supplies, cooking lessons. My mom never did nor tried to do what he did for me. 

I hope, when I had visited him, that I may have eased some loneliness off of him before he was sentenced to slow agonizing uncomfortable passing in a hospital that didn’t even give him pain meds until hopefully after I mentioned he seemed in pain...",mentalhealth,2021-01-25 23:58:52

to put it simple 
at 14 I heard whispers telling me to search for knowledge and find God . through out the years they kept getting louder . at 18 I started to have nightmares never stopped to  this day . the voice says all of them will happen they were all prophecies . the voice kept asking me to end my life because I have failed I was about to do it until Jesus himself saved me .

I know you would say that I’m a Christian or crazy. but you wouldn’t say that I’m mentally ill or need help . If I tell everything I say to people I wouldn’t be a mentally ill person. I would be a madman . the only person that knows this and saw my face was my friend. and he said I would grow up to be a serial killer. that was my best friend I knew him for 7 years since we were eleven tell now at 18 . what would others think of me. I have seen demons monsters the old voice God and the devil. after I have seen Jesus things got better . all the voices stopped but a new  voice was born a fish with limbs it looked better then the old demon voice. it says there’s is no God no path just enjoy your life and adapt . but I still see things and I believe that the prophecies are coming true . and at times I believe that I’m a prophet of the Christian faith. the reason I haven’t been to a therapist is that every one who brought something similar to what I brought was called crazy never mentally ill . so if I lose it and start preaching in the streets will no one help ? . will you just call me crazy and pass by . if you see or know someone who says something similar to me please don’t call them crazy and give them the help they need .

My PTSD was triggered by my fiancé cheating on me a few weeks before our wedding with a friend of ours and it really, really messed me up in the head. I don’t know why it did, but it did. I tried to kill myself multiple times and I wanted to die so bad because my life was literally destroyed by this girl. I hate her so much and I want to kill her. I don’t know why I wasn’t mad at him as much as I was mad at her. I’ve seen her in public once since then, at a gas station, (because we live in the same town) and I tried to attack her. I was held back by my boyfriend (who was my fiancé we ended up getting back together after we split for a while). I wanted to kill her with my bare hands. I still think about killing her every single day. I don’t know if I would actually do it but the thought occupies my mind at all times of the day. I hate her with every bone in my body. 

Should I tell my therapist? I don’t want to be arrested or committed but I know that if I had the chance, I would really hurt this girl. I know where she lives, what car she drives, her friends, her boyfriend...I could easily walk to her house right now because it’s not that far but my boyfriend stops me every time I go to walk down the driveway?

I haven't brought up the hallucination stuff or the whole ""I don't know if I'm me"" things yet but I am going to be seeing her every week so I have time I suppose.

Anyway, ever since I had told people and started getting help for this it hasn't felt right. I've spent years trying to keep all this hidden and now it feels like I've betrayed myself and wasted all those years of work by telling people. Also just feels like that its something I should be able to deal with by myself and that it isn't that bad because other people have it way worse even though I know it is something that has completely taken over my life. 

I know that talking to people, getting help, and all that are things that I am supposed to do and will probably make my life better but it feels wrong. Part of me wants to keep going to this counselor and getting help, but the rest of me just wants to hide and let myself slowly rip apart my own mind.

I've always had problems with stress and it strongly impacts my emotional states, and since the pandemic it's gotten even worse. 

I just don't feel much anymore besides stress, sadness, and apathy. I don't love what I'm doing in college anymore even though I know deep down I have a passion for it, and the only thing that motivates me is panic and guilt, I don't have a sex drive, or any feelings really, in my perfectly good relationship, I'm constantly bored and restless, my body image is starting to deteriorate, and when I do experience positive feelings they're typically fleeting and just give way to more negative feelings. I'm really worried I'm getting depressed and anxious.

My family has a history of mental health issues and I've talked to my mom in the past about accessing a therapist and she's supportive.  She's even sent me links to the therapists I can access online through the local hospital in my hometown. I've gone through the school to counseling centers because it's free and it helps for a short period of time but I always tend to slip again. So I feel like I need something more consistent and someone I've built a relationship with.  

I guess I'm just scared. It's ridiculous considering Im in a biomedical major, I understand how SSRIs and other medications for mental health work and that they're not necessarily negative or positive and it depends on the person, but I can't help but feel scared that if I do go to a psychiatrist and require medication it will change me anyway.  It's just miserable that I feel like I already know what I'm suffering with, and I already figure it's going to require more intense help and I'm scared to go through that. 

I know my boyfriend and family will love me through anything but it just hurts that I can't feel anything but apathy towards anyone and stress towards anything anymore. I want to get better for them and for myself. I'm just afraid and sad and confused. I know what I have to do I'm just afraid to do it and get back some sort of diagnosis for myself. I'm scared I won't like what I'll see. I guess I just need support from people who have been through therapy or on medication to know it will be okay.",mentalhealth,2021-01-26 00:37:57

As I child I was bullied; by both classmates and family. As I child I was obese, and was always made fun of for my weight. Because of this, I was never really confident in myself, and never really thought anything I dad had worth, or was even notable for that matter. Even when I would get academic achievements in school, my father never really cared or showed support. 

When we moved to another state, I struggled in middle school. I missed family, my close friends and it was hard to adjust. Bullying continued and my grades started to suffer because of this. As my dad is from India m, he was always big on grades and never really cared about mental health and well-being. He would further my shame of myself by comparing me to my cousins, and would constantly call me a failure...
When we moved for a second time, I had to readjust to a new place again. In high school, the relation with my father basically exploded. He was more abusing, would drink more, and blame everything on me. Having to go to school every day with that on the back of my mind was hard to deal with...My weight got really bad and by my senior year I was 269 pounds. Family would still poke fun at my weight with demeaning names. This is when I developed both bulimia and eventually the developed into anorexia. 

I was at my lowest as well, in college now, but was able to still focus on school as my goal was to prove my father wrong(which was the wrong mindset.) I was able to get a 3.56 gpa, but my home life was even worse than high school. Because I started getting skinnier and skinnier, the abuse hurt even more; both mentally and physically...One day I looked in the mirror, and I didn’t notice me anymore. I looked like a shell of myself; 108 pounds from 269...When I looked at myself and cried and pleaded with god, or any soul that could hear me. I literally saw death. One night when I was sick, I was heating up, and wanted to go to the bathroom, and I struggled and collapsed on the floor...Part of my face was temporarily paralyzed and some body pets were twitching and my mom came rushing to get me water...I felt fine after drinking a lot of water but I knew I wouldn’t be able to go to the hospital bed my dad wouldn’t want to take me...I believe I had a heat stroke or something along those lines...

After that day I made an oath to myself that I would go on a journey of self betterment no matter how hard it was...Because even Jesus went through the desert; by his lonesome with the temptation of the devil...Its been a little over a year, and with recovering on my own not being admitted into a hospital, I am now 170 pounds and have a new found love for my self. Your lowest moments really help bring perspective to life...No matter why we go through in life, no matter what others say about you...At the end of the day, only you know you best. Always give yourself love and hope...Hope is one thing that no one can take from you as it’s something you give yourself...Instilling positivity, love, affirmation, and hope in yourself helps with your mind and soul as an individual. Being an INFJ I realized that what made the lows really enhanced was that I am a very sensitive person and that I have a strong sense of emotions and emotional intelligence, and if you turn the negativity from your outside surroundings to positivity to your inner workings of yourself, you will be the best version of yourself. No matter what, every single one of us plays an important role in society. Everyone has a purpose...I hope this motivates others, and inspires others. If I can help be a positive contributor to society, then I can sleep at night knowing that I made a positive difference in someone else’s life, or even society; whether it’s small or big...

anyways, i need help. advice. support. anything.
over the past year or so, so much has happened. i was kicked out of my home and was homeless for 6 months. i lost touch with every single one of my friends and most of my family.
when i say i have zero friends now, i mean it. i don't mean i have a few internet friends and a friend next door, i mean i haven't held a conversation with anyone. other than doctors, my therapist, my boyfriend, my mom, and maybe my brother, i haven't even dared to text anyone in months. a few people have reached out to me but i never hold more than a three minute conversation. i moved back into the house i was kicked out of three or so months ago, and i'm so grateful.
i've gained lots of weight since i moved back in. it's hard for me to exercise because i'm very chronically ill, i have tachycardia and migraines and stuff pretty bad. major depressive disorder, borderline, psychosis, anxiety, and ptsd are also on the long list of diagnoses. i'm very insecure about my self image and appearance.
i recently found out i might have POTS as well, which may require very expensive treatment. i'm also coming off depo provera, a birth control method, and recently started the IUD, another birth control method, so that could be playing a very big part in my depression.
i asked my boyfriend if he could help me out with positive reinforcement (which worked wonders for me a few years back) and a bit of verbal validation to help sooth my anxiety. simple stuff, just reminding me he loves me, saying i look good, he likes my outfit, little compliments here and there basically. he doesn't seem to be supportive of that. i keep asking if he'll do it but he gets angry whenever i ask. 
i don't think he understands the gravity of how important that is to me, and he doesn't seem to notice that i'm drowning in negative thoughts. nobody really seems to notice, if i'm being honest.

so far in the span of less than a year, i was homeless, lost all my friends, gained tons of weight, may have POTS, started a new birth control method, and have gotten zero support from anyone but my therapist.
suicide is on my mind a lot. 
i feel like i've fallen in a dark hole with nobody around to help me. no matter how loudly i scream for help, nobody seems to hear.",mentalhealth,2021-01-26 00:46:06

I've been wondering if I've had depressive psychosis for a while now. Especially in the last two weeks. I wanted to describe my condition here to see if it's worth getting mental help.

I suffer from minor auditory hallucinations(Kinda). I feel like any repetitive sound or ringing starts talking to me, and it can get quite creepy sometimes. Mainly the college bell is what really makes things difficult. i feel like I can hear the voices of people around me harassing me, but when I record I can't hear anything from them. So I think it's safe to say that I have at least some minor auditory stuff. 

Delusions have been really difficult lately. I'm in high school/college, and I can't help but feel threatened by the rest of my class. I remember I felt like I'd wronged one girl somehow and that she was out to get rid of me. It turns out that she wasn't and we became kind of acquaintances. Especially on my walk home today I felt terrified of kids walking by me. I have to confess that I felt compelled to defend myself when they walked by me. I felt like they posed some sort of threat. But of course they were just kids who looked at me strangely while I started to breath deeply and have my eyes go all over the place. 

This kind of comes from my social anxiety, but sometimes I just want to find a way to free myself of everyone around me. Everytime I see a person I lose my shit, and I just want to purge that person from my sight, so I can really be free. I'm not sure how I can have peace of mind while people are walking past me, but that's likely just social anxiety. 

I feel like I'm about to act up or slip in someway. I've always been extremely discreet in the past, only having some very well hidden suicide attempts from all of my friends. No one ever did anything to me, and nothing's every happened to me. I'm autistic, but other than that nothing happened to me to make me depressed or anxious, or psychotic if I am. So it just doesn't make sense. 

Sometimes I feel like my head grows a voice of its own asking me who I want to let go on. Me or the people who watch me. Like I need to get rid of one if the other wants to go on. I rambled a lot to get some stuff off of my chest, but I'd like to know if other people think this is big enough to make a big deal out of it. I'm always pretty socially anxious so this may just be a projection of that.",mentalhealth,2021-01-26 01:14:23

I first noticed this happening when I was 15, but over the years it's become more and more noticeable, especially since I'm out of school now. In school it was less noticeable because I only had one main thing to focus on, but now that my brain tries to focus on multiple things more often it's become a lot stronger. I also think it started when I turned 15 because before I entered high school life seemed to feel more simplistic and less ""complicated"". What happens is when I'm thinking about too much and become overwhelmed my brain seems to go in this dissociative state? Like it feels for a moment I can't process what's currently happening and it feels like I'm in a dream for a moment. It's like I can see and feel what's currently happening, but my brain isn't able to make sense of it. Whenever I hear about dissociation I usually hear it brought up as dissociating from your identity or who you are, but I don't really hear about dissociating from your surroundings, which is what usually happens to me.  Every once in a while it will happen to me identity-wise (I remember for a while I would come home from school and I would genuinely have to remind myself of who I was because my brain would literally forget from being so overloaded with information), but that's only in severe cases and it's usually caused by something happening to me or my surroundings. Another thing is when something serious or really big happens it seems to take me a lot longer for me to process it than other people I know. It can take me from hours to multiple days while it seems like most other people I know can process it within a few minutes to an hour. In some cases when something happens I won't know how to respond or I'll just freeze up. I genuinely have no idea if these things are something specific to me, or if everyone goes through this and they just don't talk about it. I don't really hear these things get mentioned all that much, on the internet or real life.


On top of that, I have a really hard time getting multiple things done in a day. I feel like I think about doing things more than I actually do them, and even when I get just one or two things done in a day that feels really accomplishing for me. I used to think this was because I had anxiety, but over time my anxiety has eased up and I don't feel anxious about doing stuff anymore, so I know now the issue is deeper than that. I think I might have executive dysfunction because of this, but I'm not diagnosed with anything. It's possible I could have adhd but I don't want to make any serious assumptions without knowing. I'm almost always daydreaming about something, it's rare when I'm not and sometimes I feel like that's a factor of my dissociation problems happening so often. I feel like I question if my brain is really in the real world sometimes, I often feel like I'm just usually fantasizing about stuff instead of thinking realistically, and it makes me question my maturity sometimes. Sometimes I feel like I'm not a real adult. I'm definitely capable of dealing with serious things and working hard, but my brain has to be in the right place. It usually is *most* of the time, but then whenever I'm thinking too hard about something or I'm too overwhelmed it starts to do this. And I don't know if that's completely healthy all the time.


I also have an attachment problem when I get close to people, but it only happens when I've known them for a long time and I'm able to be vulnerable around them. I hear and read about attachment issues every now and then, but I don't really see them described in the way that I have them. For me it's like when someone I care about has something bad happen to them or they feel bad, I start to also feel bad to the moment of feeling completely crushed about it, and sometimes I feel like I end up feeling it way stronger than they do. This thing also ends up giving me really bad anxiety when it gets bad, and I'm worried in how that will make me cope as a person in any kind of friendship or relationship. I don't want people to end up thinking they need to walk on eggshells around me or anything, and I don't want people to feel like they have to avoid bringing things up to prevent this. But I just feel like I'm so sensitive when it comes to this, and I wish I wasn't. I've looked into possibly being an empath or an HSP, but I only seem to have these problems when it comes to interacting with people and not with anything else. Honestly I just want to have a healthy way of being close to people, to just feel close and comfortable around them but not to attached to the point where my brain tells me my mood depends on them. That's not normal, or realistic, or healthy. I just wish it wasn't that way.


I kind of wrote this in a rush and while tired so my writing here isn't as precise as it usually is, and I apologize about that. My overall point of my post is, does anyone know what I have? Because I haven't been able to figure it out and I've been looking all over. It feels like whatever my situation is it seems to fall between the lines while also being so specific, so I haven't been able to really know what's going on with me for sure. And does anyone know of any ways to overcome this? I want to grow, I want to be better. I know there's ways to get through this and I want to challenge my brain, I want to be able to overcome what currently feels impossible. Any advice is appreciated.",mentalhealth,2021-01-26 01:31:59

I don’t think I have any strong bonds with anyone who I can tell all this to, who won’t get scared cuz of it, hence this post. 

To give a little context, I (26f) was diagnosed with depression, anxiety and mild bipolar disorder back in 2016. But I’m positive I have been suffering from it since when I was a child. 

I remember being aloof, not feeling like I’m a part of my family since I was a child. My parents have a history of neglect, verbal and physical abuse with me. It sounds so aweful when I write it out in words but I’m not sure if it is that bad? A lot of brown kids have gone through physical or atleast verbal abuse by their parents. Sometimes I feel like, I’m just making it all up in my head, that I want to feel helpless? If that makes any sense...

I’m so old and I still haven’t been able to become independent because of my mental health and history of an abusive relationship with a partner. I literally wasted my young years on that one dude and then many after that, healing from it. I don’t think I’m worthless or useless, although that thought comes very often. But it’s mostly because there hasn’t been any significant growth in my career. Everyone I meet tells me how talented I am, etc but it all feels like a lie tbh, something they’d say to make me feel better. 

After many broken friendships, I’m at a point where I don’t feel any attachment towards my own family. I truly don’t even feel like I belong. They have always just helped me monetarily and nothing else. I have tried to understand their traumas and where they come from but I’ve never been reciprocated the same. 

I feel so helpless and aimless, I just want to move out of their house so I can never talk to them again but most of the times I’m too lethargic to even get out of bed. I’m so pathetic, my family doesn’t fail to make me realise that often. 

At the same time, the fact that they still support me makes me obliged to them. Idk what to do! I’m trying to seek therapy but I can’t pay for it atm. Opening up to any friend is also disappointing every time because they’re not exactly therapists, they can’t help me and they also have their own lives. 

I feel like I’m stuck in a loop. Idk how long I can go on like this. I wish I wasn’t so scared to kill myself because I don’t wish to live anymore. There’s nothing in this world that makes me want to live. 

Please don’t give me any motivations speeches, I’m so exhausted and nobody understands that I really just feel trapped inside my body, inside a person who keeps making the same mistakes, keeps going around in circles. I’m so tired.... wish I could just vanish.",mentalhealth,2021-01-26 02:15:15

I realized though it boiled down to two things:

1) My method on grieving: We all grief differently. Mine was like a tidal wave that crashes every once in a while. The OST in Minecraft is very similar to the way my grief works. It pops in infrequently and randomly throughout gameplay, but seemingly it all makes sense in the grand scheme of things. I loved it; it felt like I was understood and attuned with something despite its abstraction. 

2) The music itself: Calming, atmospheric, melancholic - all the positive adjectives I could think of when describing good sad ambient music. I'm also a sucker for piano synths and nostalgic qualities and having played MC throughout my childhood definitely contributed to my longing to pick up the game once more.

I never even played MC for 8 years - so when I took a step back and attempted to reflect on where this longing was coming from, I came to this conclusion.

It's basically a plan you setup with your GP and maybe some friends or a loved one to setup a support network to help.

But aside from that it also entitles you to a subsidy to see a psychologist. You get 6 initial subsidised sessions (my psychologist charges $150~ per session and I pay only $42) and then the psychologist can apply for you to have 4 more.

After that if you go back to your GP they can apply for another 10 (6+4) for you in the same calendar year.

This is both in response to the hell that 2020 was and also, and I hate to say it but my GP told me this. It is now cheaper to treat mental health then it is to ignore it.

It costs the economy more to ignore mental health now then to treat it so the government has expanded the subsidy program.",mentalhealth,2021-01-26 02:33:33

I need to explain how it developed. Let's just start by saying, I started dating a guy 4 months ago, and in the first 1.5 months it was okay, I did feel some sort of anxiety and paranoia that he was cheating on me or texting other girls, and I did overthink it and cried like crazy, but it lasted only for a week and I rarely thought about it again. However, as I spent more time with him, I started to feel like he wasn't doing enough for me, he wasn't sweet enough, and I started to keep score of the times he upset me.

As more months go by, things really started to go downhill when I started to keep score more intensely in the relationship, and it was building a lot of resentment. I was upset over many things, such as, him not posting me on social media, him being reluctant to take photos in public places, him not being sweet enough, etc. I was constantly thinking that he wasn't doing enough for me, and that I needed more from him, and that he wasn't being a good boyfriend. But the biggest issue was texting. He's not a phone person, and he has an iPad that he uses more than his phone. Because of this, he doesn't reply to texts as fast as I do, and to me texting is quite a basic, important thing to do in a rs. Over time, his slow texts got to me and I would have impulsive reactions where during the night I'd explode, feel so much anger, and picked fights. But the next morning, I would feel VERY calm, and I wouldn't be able to understand why I was so mad the night before. This has occured many times, where I was extremely angry at his slow texts, pick a fight, and then feel okay the next day and start making jokes and being soft to him again. In fact, I almost broke up with him last night, I almost sent an impulse text, but I didn't, and now we're fine.

I know I seemed to have painted him in a bad light, but he is a good person overall and we have had alot of good moments. But I do feel like I alternate between cycles of hating him and loving him. I do feel like I'm 'splitting' a lot.

Also, I feel like I don't seem to remember my sad and angry episodes. There were countless of times I cried, and wrote my feelings down. But if I read them back the next day, I wouldn't understand why I felt sad, and I wouldn't understand why I cried. Same with anger, when I think back to yesterday when I was angry, I wouldn't understand why I was angry, and think that it wasn't a big deal. But the truth is, at that moment itself, it really was a big deal lol.


Ps : another example of my mood swing/splitting is that, sometimes I'm okay with the slow texts, and sometimes I'm not. Some days I feel like I cannot accept his slow texts and think ""fuck him, he's terrible and you should find someone better"" and then there will be days where I think ""hey, it's fine, give him some space! Just chill :)""

This happens ALOT with friends too. I'd get super annoyed with a friend, bitch about them and say bad things, and then 30 minutes later when I'm calm I would be shocked at myself for being so angry. And then I'd go back to being very nice to that friend again.

So that's the mood swing/splitting part that I'm concerned about. 

Other than that, I do self-harm quite regularly during low times, and I do feel different about myself almost everyday. Some days I think I'm amazing and deserve better , and some days I'm all insecure and needy. 

TLDR : I have intense mood swings, usually alternating between extreme anger followed by being very calm. After being calm, I can't seem to understand why I got angry/sad in the first place. I experience splitting where I'd hate someone with my gut and then love them and go soft for them within a day. And I also self harm quite regularly and have an unstable sense of image.

Questions :
1)What's wrong with me? What am I dealing with? It feels like many things at once
2)Could my boyfriend possibly be my FP which is why I'm so obsessive and calculative when it comes to him?",mentalhealth,2021-01-26 02:51:51

Growing up I was a very successful kid, i had a lot of successes in sport, mainly soccer and i prided myself on being in the top of my classes. Everything was going great, I Had a nice upringing, my parents supported me and always pushed for the best in me. My brother was always quick to shoot me down but I always wanted to be better than him. As high school started and i was getting older I started to notice i was feeling extremlely sad and anxious for no reason, i would be sitting in my room and it would just hit me out of nowhere, I started to get very jealous about my girlfriend going anywhere and really just became a person i didnt want to be, i started getting drunk smoking cigarettes, weed, disobeying my parents, distancing myself from everyone, you know stuff that most teenagers would do, or so I thought. I wasn't engaging in anything in school, i thought it was cool to not care, and things i used to seem passoionate about seemed too 'cringe' or 'not cool' enough, I just became this very uncaring person. I left my girlfriend for absolutely no reason, i stole money from her, and felt no remorse, only guilt and embarassment that people had found out. I continued to use drugs, couldnt keep a job as i didnt care about anything, this went on for a while until i ended up mugging someone outside of an ATM, I wouldn't have turned myself in had i not been identified by people i knew in the cctv footage. Why do i not care anymore ? I want to care i have a wife and a child on the way now and i want so badly to live in happiness and create a nice environment for my child. but I just need to sort this mental health issue out.

I tried to break it down to drug use, my symptoms only came out as i started smoking cigarettes and weed, although they continue to persist when i am not on it. Could it be trauma ? i was in quite a heavy car accident which definitely shocked me to say the least. Was it my brother constantly putting me down whenever i did well finally catching up with me ?

&amp;#x200B;

Please reddit, my story is so long and there is so much missing i know that there is not much to go on, i am very self aware about most of my issues which i thought would be a benefit, but is now sort of acting as a 'haha you know whats wrong but you cant do anything about it' sort of thing.

List of my symptoms:

* depression, feeling sad, numb, for seemingly no apparent reason
* cant focus, i cant keep focused on one particular thing or goal at a time, my mind is constantly chagning and i cant keep up with it.
* overthinking, i am constantly worrying about things big or small, it fills id say about 80% of my actualy daily brain function, its probably the most annoying and life changing of my symptoms.
* memory loss, i cant remember alot from my childhood, i cant recall much of what happened last week and i definitely couldnt tell you what i had for dinner last night. People tell me stories that i was involved in and to my knowledge i was never there, this one is frustrating and sometimes heartbreaking.
* no self esteem, i hate myself and i have no self belief, i dont think im capable of anything and i dont think im of any worth, it doesnt matter what any great things people could say about me.
* maybe coming into overthinking territory but im constantly spaced out or away with the faeries, i dont feel grounded at all.
* my dependancy on weed to deal with my symptoms.

I am on 300mg of venlafaxine and 4mg risperidone 

Any questions please feel free to ask, im not very good at explaining things and i doubt i have finished on the same topic i started on and am definitely too impatient to reread and change it.

This wasn’t really intentional, it just kind’ve happened as I’ve been quite busy lately so I guess I never found myself reaching for it, or really even thinking about it. I’ve been on and off a variety of medication for about 2-3 years. 
Here and there I experience very mild symptoms, though I can go about my day and feel okay again after a relatively short amount of time. But I’m no longer experiencing wrenching panic attacks, mornings where it’s so hard to get up, or extreme waves of constant negative dead-ended thoughts, etc,.
This post does make me question the level of my overthinking though lol.

It’s not like my circumstances have drastically changed or anything either. If anything, I’m surrounded by other anxious, depressed people more than I was before (friends &amp;amp; family), nd I also have more responsibilities+workload than I did before. 
2020 was rough. Somehow I’ve just gotten better myself. I think about the state of mind I was in before put in my current situation, and I wonder how I’ve gotten this far. Now, it’s like even with inconveniences I manage to get through the day, just like everyone else. It’s not such a difficult thing.

Anyway, I wonder if a part of the reason for that could be related to all of my daily doctor visits, and use of medication in the past. Not saying it was making me worse, but maybe my perception of those things kind’ve hindered the benefits it’s meant to provide. What I mean is me taking meds and going to the doctors for so long thinking that it was necessary might’ve been the source of my never ending self destructive, hopeless, thoughts about myself and life. Because if I had to do all these things to “fix” me, there must’ve been so much wrong with me. Especially given the fact that other people like me could get by without such things. 

Not saying that as a fact, I believe that was just my thought process. It may have kept me in the “ I need to be fixed “ mindset.
I know there’s many ways one could interpret anything like this but for whatever reason it bugs me and I’m curious to know what others experiences are with medication for depression/anxiety, and ADHD.",mentalhealth,2021-01-26 05:25:01

(Sorry),"Hi everyone! I’m so sorry for the long read, I just want you to tell me that I’m not crazy and not making up stuff.  I’m being raised by a narcissist - ever since I was a kid, she’s been shouting and screaming at me and making me insecure. Sometimes I’m too fat, sometimes too skinny, sometimes my ass is not big enough. She tells me openly, which is hurtful. I had a mental breakdown on a family dinner because her and another person were pointing out how shitty I looked before - how fat I was (objectively, I wasn’t. I was still skinny.) and even their husbands agreed, apparently. 

The stuff that my mom tells me to make me insecure has manifested in me subconsciously - it affects my dating life and I keep thinking I am not enough for anyone, so I shouldn’t try to date. I end up pushing away people who get too close, even though I’m trying to fix it and face my insecurities she caused. I am also severely depressed and have anxiety attacks sometimes - but each time I leave the house, I’m happy.

My mother always blamed me for her problems, and how I made her sacrifice too many things (I was a child back then and still didn’t understand why I was getting accused.)
There is not a single day that can go calmly, but I never get mad and still act warmly towards her like surprising her with hugs or presents and so on. I even apologize to her when I haven’t done anything, because she will never say the word sorry. It got to the point I started starving myself because I just can’t bring myself to eat.

Once I asked a simple question a little annoyedly (concerning some documents I needed parental help with) - and she lashed out at me, threw a tantrum about how i need to lower my tone. I was speaking in my normal tone. She screamed at me until I started shaking and crying, and then she started imitating what I was doing and calling me crazy. She keeps saying I’m using her just to get away - which is not true, I just want to go to university out of state. I keep asking her, “Why do you scream at me? Can’t you say it in a normal tone?” And she keeps telling me how I screamed at her first, and she has done no such thing... 
There are times when she’s in a good mood and treats me nicely, and I feel like I can open up to her about some teenage stuff I always needed motherly support with. I had to figure out everything on my own. But once I do open up, then she uses it against me and forms her own opinions about how I am. 

Maybe there’s something wrong with me that is causing her to act this way, I do not know. This is one side of the story. I do not know what she sees or thinks - she thinks I’m just a manipulative child who’s using her for her goals. I really don’t know. Please advise me something.",mentalhealth,2021-01-26 05:49:12

Can’t even pick up when it’s my friends calling. Always ALWAYS assuming the worst if I were to pick up the call.,"It’s actually ridiculous how scared I am of picking up the phone. I don’t save numbers. I don’t make calls. I don’t pick up calls. Not my friends, family, anyone. 

Usually if it’s friends or family calling I decline and then wait for them to either text me, or if not I send them a “?”. In these cases I always assume they are ringing because they are mad at me or I did something wrong which is why they are calling. 

Now numbers I don’t know, or no caller ID, or unknown number, those are TERRIFYING. My fears go from something as simple as the police telling me they saw me do something illegal and I’m going to be arrested to possibly even a stalker saying they can see me. 

I understand how ridiculous it seems and I AGREE. And I always tell myself oh it’s nothing. But as much as I tell myself what I’m thinking is impossible. I can never pick up the phone because what if? 

I also think I know where this bad habit/irrational fear came from. When I was in high school whenever I was out with my friends at night my parents would ring and say I need to come home within the next 30 minutes. Which was usually was impossible because it would take closer to an hour to travel back home. So usually I would just ignore the calls and make my way home and simply say my phone was on silent mode or out of battery. (Always followed by a lecture lol) From there the fear of my phone only grew. 

I’m nearly 20 and haven’t been living with my parents for months nearly a year and yet here I am still terrified to pick up the phone. 

Does anyone have any advice on how to get over this? It’s embarrassing and really frustrating that I can’t even pick up my friends calls.",mentalhealth,2021-01-26 05:50:44

I’m 29 and have just moved out out of my mums house.

My mum has helped a lot in life. She’s given me money towards this house, helped with work, helped with a police case I was in due to a false accusation - loads.

When my mum married my dad they joined their surnames to make a double barrelled surname but they split. I decided growing up that I’d like to change my name to that of my dads. My mum was so upset as I was taking away what was that of her late mother’s and so she told me I wasn’t allowed. I waited until I was 18 and did it myself. She says that me changing my name was the meanest thing anybody had ever done to her. She literally chose to remove that name from her own life...

My mum has always classed me as one of the kids. She constantly told me to do things. Hoover, wash the dishes, do this, do that. She’d just walk into my room and tell me to do something. I could go as far as turning on the hoover for 30 seconds, not hoover, and then say I was done where she’d say “see, much better!”. She made a rule re dinner where the second person in out of me and my brother had to wash the dishes. I’d go in first intentionally every single day but every single day she’d still tell me to do the dishes - not if it was the other way round though. She’d always decide things for me too. She’d ask things like “are you needing this cupboard for when you move out?” and when I’d reply with no she’d say “well I think you need one anyway so I’m going to look online for one”. She has decided how I need to live and just doesn’t listen to me. She phones me to let me know when we’re going to the doctor because she’ll have made an appointment for herself but made one for me too and will come in, kicking off if I say I want to see my doctor alone...

At dinner time she shouts “dinner!” loudly to get everyone around the house to come to the kitchen. If we’re not there in a minute or two she shouts again but this time more aggressively, almost hinting she’s pissed off and to get there now. I’ve said a few times when walking in after she second time “calm down, jeez”. She’s said “what, I’m just telling you it’s dinner?”. After dinner I’d put my plate on the side and occasionally she’d raise her voice and say sternly “dishwasher!” - everyone left dishes on the side, especially them after dinner, but only I’d get shouted at. During lockdown last year she tried to break that habit and so I took it upon myself to start putting things in the dishwasher daily. I broke the habit and continued even after lockdown. My brother broke his habit but then broke the habit of putting things in the dishwasher after lockdown finished. I could put something in the dishwasher and 5 seconds later he’d put things on the side but have no comments made...

When I was 14 I was forced to get a summer job. I couldn’t just go out with mates during the summer holidays and play, I had to go and work at a garden centre and work. My brother wasn’t forced to do the same but my mums excuse was that he went to college after high school. We didn’t know he was going to do that at the age of 14?! One thing for him and another for me but she doesn’t see it in the slightest.

I lost a lot of weight a few years ago and so happily put on a few lbs here and there now knowing how to lose it again but she’ll openly tell me it’s noticeable.

She is determined for me to marry and have kids ASAP. I don’t even have a girlfriend due to trust issues but she’s constantly saying “get a girlfriend or you’ll end up like uncle Steve” who’s only found love in his 40’s. So?! “Do what I want or ‘suffer’”?! Even my step dad butts in saying I’ll do it when I’m ready.

Before the move out she was determined for me to buy everything from a charity shop. She’s trying to make me live here without doing anything up, saying I should do it up 2 months before moving out to make a profit. I want to be happy, taking pride in the fact that this house is “mine” and so obviously I said no every time. She said she found a secondhand bed frame on Facebook that she’d buy for me and then we’d go to the charity shop after. I raised my voice this time and said “no, how many times?!” - she must have asked up to 10 times in total. Trying to “bribe” me into doing it her way rather than doing it my way. She just walked away and didn’t get me the bed. 

We went to her step mums house who had some spare dishes for me, but I told my mum I plan to buy a new dinner set so they’re not needed. To be polite I took a couple but then she stood there looking in her cupboards saying “if they’re available, we’ll have that one, that one, that one, that one”, just completely overlooking what I’d told her about buying new. She knowingly took her extra unneeded dishes. I’ve already got my own set and none of them were even used but my words were completely disregarded.

She told me after viewing the house that it’d be perfect and she’d pick me up once a week to take me shopping at Iceland. The estate agent laughed and said “not getting rid of mummy then”. At no point did I say that we were going shopping at Iceland once a week, there is a co-op basically next door to this house? I told her that it’s not happening as I’ll go to the co-op. She said they’re going to stock my house for the first time. I said thanks. They took me to Iceland... she wants me to get used to all of their products so that I want to go again. She let me keep all of the shopping bags afterwards but I told her the co-op next door gives them out for free so I don’t need them. She said “you’ll need them for your once a month shop at Iceland, or whenever we go”. So while she’s accepted I won’t go shopping with her weekly, she’s decided that I’m going with her monthly... no - I’m not?!

When we argued I’d get frustrated at her not listening to me that I’d sometimes call her a moron or idiot, sometimes with the “f” word in front of it. During the police case she chose for me to use one image as evidence rather than two. No matter how much I said two is better she chose that one is “more powerful” and so I called her an idiot, frustrated that she chose for me what I said I didn’t want to do in a case that could have affected my life if the lies weren’t exposed. I just didn’t have a say. But overall, she’d see things as me being horrible for calling her names when really she’s only being “nice”. So I’m the bad guy. 

She gave me a lift to work not long before moving out and she said she was going to come round on Wednesday. I explained that I hadn’t moved out yet and I actually plan to have up to a couple of months to myself because I’m excited to live life on my own. She tried guilt tripping me by saying I’m stealing her money and ditching her. I ended up crying to a colleague in a meeting room later that day because of how much that hurt... trying to make me feel so guilty that I do what she wants? The first thing the colleague asked was “Jesus, is she always like that?”.

My brother just does whatever she says which makes it harder for me. She’ll walk in at 11am and say “right, get up and empty the dishwasher - we’re going out”. He just says ok. He doesn’t seem to grasp that she is controlling him and actually sees me as the bad guy with the way that I argue.

We went shopping to buy some bits for my house the other day and I’d already bought a few bits myself. Anything I already had she’d basically call me stupid for buying, saying I could have gotten it free out of her. So from “shopping in charity shops only”, to “you could have gotten it free out of me at B&amp;Q”?! But I’m stupid?!

As a child I used to go outside when she was smoking to beg her to stop as both of her parents died from it - I found it really selfish. She’d shout at me and tell me to go away. Now she says “I’ll stop smoking when you stop drinking!”. Me and mates go to the pub or enjoy a night in town and she tries telling me I’m “a borderline alcoholic” and tries to make me feel that I rely on alcohol as much as she relies on nicotine. I go for nights out once a week tops. She’s addicted to smoking and drinks wine every night... if I point that out she argues that I drink more units than her overall so it doesn’t matter and I’m worse.

So today she came to mine where she brought me a calendar and suggested I put it on my kitchen shelf. I said thanks but I don’t need it as I can use my phone instead. She said “ok, that’s fine” and put it on my kitchen shelf anyway, having decided for me that I was going to have it anyway.

It turned into a small bicker but I used the word “controlling”. She said “you know what? Screw the coffee. Seeya”, and she stormed out the front door.

She’s emailed me and has pretty much ended our relationship because I called her controlling again. She’s told me that she knows I bitch about her to my mates, colleagues and dad when really I just vent after her petty arguments. I love my mum but whether she can see it or not, she’s tried to control and manipulate me to a certain extent, far beyond me being a child. She tries to make me feel like the bad guy every time and brings up all the times she’s helped me, saying I’m clearly not thankful, and brings up any times I’ve called her a name. She just completely disregards my points and turns it on me with her points.

Am I a bad guy? Or does she not see what she’s doing? Is what she’s doing bad? Now I’ve had a week of living on my own I realise how “bad” it potentially was and I’m in no way upset that I’ve potentially lost my mum...",mentalhealth,2021-01-26 05:56:30

Please pray. Or send good vibes. Or something. I’m losing all hope.,"My older sister is diagnosed bipolar. She is 29. She has been severely hallucinating for about two weeks straight. Maybe more. I honestly have stopped keeping track. My parents are so exhausted and they have been doing everything right as caretakers. They are making sure she is fed, making sure she knows she is loved, working closely with her psychiatrist to make sure her meds are helping her, she has a psychologist, they sleep in her room at night when she’s scared and needs someone to comfort her, fucking everything an amazing parent would do. Despite everything, she is still so sick. The sickest I have ever seen her in my life. 

With covid, psychiatric hospitals are hotbeds for infection and there is little to nothing these hospitals can do about the spread of covid. We are caught between a rock and a hard place. Do we keep her here, where she will be at home around people she knows and loves, but risk our own sanity, or do we take her to the psychiatric hospital, which she still has PTSD from prior hospitalizations, and she may get covid and would probably die given how sick she is? Obviously, if it gets any worse, we will have to take her to the hospital, which is looking more and more likely. But if she gets covid, she could die, and/or infect my family if she is discharged with covid, and my parents are at risk. 

We are so fucking stuck. We have nowhere to go. My parents are sleep deprived. I’m sleep deprived. We are damned if we do and damned if we don’t. She has tried every single medication available to treat her and she gets every single brutal side effect. 

I don’t think she is going to make it. And I’m preparing myself for if I lose her. I would not cal myself a religious person. But all I have left is to pray and have others pray for my family. Please fucking help me. Please pray. Or send good vibes. Or whatever you believe in.",mentalhealth,2021-01-26 06:06:46

i did not proof read this so idk 

and he/they prns please.

I’m currently 14, almost 15. I’m still “in” school but I haven’t been doing any work for months and months. I can’t do it anymore. its so hard, and I have zero support. 

two months ago my mental health wasnt good, but it was better than usual. so despite not wanting to at all, I asked my dad if I could possibly get a therapist, because I know it would help so so much. he said “thats such a good idea!” so I know now that at least in the back of his head, he understands I need help. I’ve been waiting ever since then for a therapist, and my mental health has done nothing but go down. 

he still hasn’t gotten one, even though we have insurance to totally cover it. I hate him. It’s hard enough for me to get up everyday, and the one time I had enough motivation to ask for something, he forgot. he always forgets. when I want something, even something as simple as a new shirt, I have to remind him multiple times.

I still share a room with my brother. my side only has enough room for my bed, a desk, and a side table. I have no personal space. and yet, every single day I have to take care of my two younger siblings because my dad is at work from 6am to 9pm. most of the time he isnt even working, just in between jobs getting coffee with his friends. he works as a plumber/painter/ etc. just basic house repair and renovation. its a hard job, I understand that. but its come to the point where he’s literally neglecting us.

he treats me like im my siblings parent. like theyre 100% my responsibility. when they do something “bad” (which usually isnt even bad, he just gets mad when someone inconveniences him slightly) he always says to me “___ did this today. Make sure it doesnt happen again.” or “___ wont do this. what am I supposed to do”. im 14. he is 47. I literally should not have to be giving him parenting advice, nor am I even qualified to be giving him advice.

He wont get me diagnosed, he wont listen to me ever. I think I have anxiety, depression, and possibly adhd. ive stayed up hours going over symptoms and asking people who are diagnosed about their experiences. i just want to know the reason why I feel so outcasted from society. why I want to kill myself every. single. day. why I cant even turn around without thinking someone is going to creep up behind me and brutally murder me. why I can’t go out in public without sobbing. why sometimes, I can’t get up, or even move in the morning because “whats the point” 

maybe if I was diagnosed, I could get medication that would possibly allow me to be awake one second without getting an intrusive thought that tells me “hmm, wouldn’t it be fun to pour boiling water on yourself. or maybe you should kill your pet that you would never harm and love with your whole life.” 

not to mention the fact that i’m trans and bi. I have enough personal struggles. I also struggle with eating disorders that go from me starving myself, to me not being able to stop eating. some days when i get up, my whole body doesn’t stop shaking for hours. I cry myself to sleep every night. 

I also have to deal with constant loss because as a way to “say sorry” for his mistakes, my dad buys us chickens. us kids take care of them to our best ability. we love them with our life. i would already be dead if I didn’t have them. but, my dad doesnt care about them. the only reason they have a secure coop and run is because of me. for years i got attached to past chickens, and for years because of my dad, they got killed by animals. for so long ive had to deal with this constant loss of the loves of my life. I adore my chickens. they are my sun. so when they die it just makes everything worse. because of this I have issues with attachment. 

currently we havent had any chickens die for about a year, want to know why? because I had to literally scream at my dad to take 30 minutes out of his day to just fix the hole in their pen. 30. minutes. it took half an hour to fix it. and now no attacks for a year. if he just CARED even a little bit. if he just took a few minutes out of his day to fix the pen years and years ago, none of those wonderful birds would’ve had to die in such a brutal way. none of my baby chicks would’ve had to be torn away from me, right after they were shoved in my face by my dad. 

so many times i had to go through the despair of going outside just to see my chickens dead. 

anyways off the topic of chickens deaths so i can wrap this up. 

I have much more traumatic things that have happened and I tried to type them out but I cant do it. all I want is help. I don’t know what to do.
im hanging on by a thread and that thread right now is my chicken pearls. she needs me to live, so i cant die. but she such a burden. i need to watch her all day everyday. 

i cant do anything myself when shes here, but if she wasn’t here id kill myself. im stuck in an endless cycle.

They’ve been working to fix all the issues and fact that a few people do 10 jobs while others can just say nah I don’t wanna do that and continue to make the same funds while having a stress free day. I know I’m in control of my feelings and I’ve worked hard to learn how to control and direct them appropriately and thought I had done a good job. I live with my parents again, and we haven’t been butting heads but I blew up the other day at them over some little shit and apologized like usual but they came at me calling me out for what I said and just told me how bad they had it etc etc. I have had health insurance but to go anywhere takes a month at best so I keep putting that off..... Back in the day when I was off dope, if I was EVER honest about my past the therapist etc would chalk it up to the drugs and do nothing for me.... I never left with good advice or things to practice. Just told them my story or part of it again and was sent home...  now I just can’t fucking take this shit. I DO think about suicide all the time but what it would be like after, like how my parents would probably tell people how sad they are but that I’m finally in a better place because I was just unhappy here on earth. I just want someone to make an effort to help me out and haven’t had any friends since getting off dope 5 years ago. I was all good with quarantining and being all alone because ive been doing that up to this point,but i can’t do it anymore. After HR figured some things out I said yes to a new spot but then it changed slightly in work and I still said yes just desperate for a change at work. Well I’m supposed to start that job in an hour and I can’t do this anymore. I’m done. I won’t even call and I have never been that person. It’s my turn to put my mental health before the thought of these people not shipping some stupid part out in time and being up my ass and non supportive about it too. I hate my job but love the rest of my life. I will take flak for this from me parents who will call me a quitter but that’s fine cause I’m a quitter for sure. That’s how I got off dope! I became a quitter. I’ll let a day or 3 go by and look for employment online and call some interviews back abs hopefully have a job next week again but right now I need to DO ME and take my mental health more seriously. If you’re out there struggling you are with many of us and we are all going to get through what we’re going through if we battle the worst of the worst times. You will gain scars and wounds but you will come out stronger too. Just wanted to get all of this off my chest. Thanks people.",mentalhealth,2021-01-26 06:51:03
1611662076,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/l5ciiy/the_three_faces_of_worry_uncertainty_control_and/,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/l5ciiy/the_three_faces_of_worry_uncertainty_control_and/,l5ciiy,1,"The three faces of Worry: Uncertainty, Control and Responsibility."," 

Worry  is the name we give to a repetitive way of thinking, which is closely  linked to how we feel emotionally and in our bodies. It is concerned  with future threat, and readily involves imagining the ‘worse case  scenario’. Worry can be thought of as the continual need to ask the  question ‘what if?’. Needless to say, it’s hard work and it makes us  feel rubbish.

There are several theories  to explain how worry works, and how it can cause us to feel anxious and  depressed. There are some concepts that link these theories together.  These I call the three faces of worry: Uncertainty, Control and  Responsibility. In order to help you recognize the roles that these  faces of worry play in your life, let’s have a look at a case of  pathological worry:

Jenna  struggles with worry. She worries about a range of things, but most  often she worries about her family. Last week she was enjoying Sunday  lunch with her daughter and son in law. When the meal was finished, her  daughter and her husband got ready to leave Jenna’s house and return to  their own home by car. Jenna asked her daughter to let her know when  they had arrived home safely by sending her a text message. Jenna  engaged in this behaviour in response to a worrisome thought that often  pops in to her mind in this sort of situation. This thought was “what if  they crash the car on the way home?”. Jenna’s daughter agrees to let  her know that all is OK once they get home, and she and her husband set  off. Jenna was then preoccupied with her phone as she continues to worry  about the possibility of her daughter and son in law being involved in a  car crash. She imagined a high speed crash, resulting in the deaths of  her daughter and son in law. She imagined how she would feel after  losing them, and the effect their deaths would have on the rest of the  family. She felt increasingly anxious, until she received a text from  her daughter, followed by a great sense of relief. In this one encounter  we can see the three faces of worry are all present.

**Face number 1: Uncertainty**

Jenna  is intolerant of uncertainty, just as someone might be intolerant of  alcohol. That is, she habitually avoids it. The person who never drinks  might find themselves feeling sick and intoxicated after a large whisky,  Jenna feels very anxious and uncomfortable when she is exposed to  situations involving some possibility of harm and where the outcome is  unknown. She is able to cope in the short term by seeking certainty so  that she does not have to tolerate uncertainty for any prolonged length  of time.

**Face number 2: Control**

In  seeking reassurance from her daughter, and in worrying about the  prospect of the worst possible outcome to the situation (by imaging it  and the consequences of that outcome in terms of ‘what if?’), Jenna is  asserting a degree of control over the situation. She is not only  seeking certainty where there is none, she is seeking to exert control  over an outcome which she has no control over. Seeking control over  something brings with it a short term reward and links this face of  worry with the previous face of worry — that is it increases our sense  of certainty over the outcome. You are ‘taking the wheel’ so to speak.  There is however also a price to pay as well, which leads us on to the  final third face of worry.

**Face number 3: Responsibility**

The  old adage ‘with great power comes great responsibility’ can be applied,  though perhaps with less grandiosity, to Jenna and her worry. As she  attempts to exert control over a situation, then she must also accept a  degree of responsibility for the outcome of that situation in proportion  to the control she exerts. Therefore if the worst, or any bad outcome,  does happen she is free to assume that this is her fault. If the worst  does not happen (which is the most likely outcome) then she is  reinforcing her behaviour and will likely continue to worry and ask for  reassuring text messages in future. It is the repetition of these  behaviours which maintains the anxiety, exhaustion and low mood we  readily associate with worry.

So  how does Jenna, or you, or anyone else overcome these three faces of  worry and start to feel better? The first step is allow yourself to  build up a tolerance to uncertainty by removing all the steps you go to  to avoid it. If you ask others for reassurance, then make a note of all  the situations you are likely to do this in and try your best to avoid  doing so when those situations come up again. It will be hard, so it’s  best to do this gradually by simply aiming to go for longer and longer  periods of ‘not knowing’.

The  second step is accepting that your control over things is limited to —  well, very little. If we are to think of things in a purely logical way  we would readily accept that none of the behaviours Jenna has exhibited —  be it worrying itself, or seeking reassurance from her daughter via  text message — actually prevent a car crash from occurring or indeed  make it more or less likely to occur. If Jenna were to come to the same  conclusion, imagine how her behaviour would change. She would be free  from fruitless attempts to exert control over a world which spins on  it’s axis whether we like it or not.

If  we are able to expose ourselves to uncertainty, perhaps even come to  appreciate the more enjoyable aspects of it, and to reign in our  attempts to control the inherently uncontrollable, what does this mean  for our sense of responsibility? Well, if one believes that the world is  an unpredictable place, and that they can control it to the extent that  they can protect themselves and their loved ones from harm, then of  course they will feel the weight of responsibility. They will feel that  weight, and the psychological distress which goes with it, to a far  greater extent than someone who accepts that the world is an  unpredictable place…and that’s that. All it takes is for someone to  lower their guard for a suitable amount of time — a week or two even —  and to stop trying to see threats coming and there by allay disaster for  a most valuable realization to sink in. The realization that terrible  things happen, but they don’t happen all that often, and when they do,  they do so in complete indifference to you.

So, don’t worry about it.",mentalhealth,2021-01-26 06:54:36

Hello 2 years ago on my 14th birthday I was sexually abused by a friend (no penetration) and it’s been really hard for me to have a normal life ever since. I get nightmares panic attacks and sometimes it looks a lot like ptsd. And it stopped for a while but it came back not long ago every time I have sexual relationships with my bf (bless his hearth he is the best) I get these panic attacks where I start to hyper ventilate and I get scared even if I’m in a safe area I just get scared shake and start to cry. 

Yesterday I asked my parents for a therapist because the school couldn’t offer one, when my mom asked me why I told her of the above. 
She told me that because there was no penetration and that the police man/ investigator couldn’t say 100% that it happened my mom said that it just never happened and that it’s all in my head and that I should just shut up because I’m a « whiny bitch »   She also told me that she got raped and that she’s completely fine now and that I’m making a big deal of something that shouldn’t be that bad. 

I haven’t stopped crying and thinking about it and frankly idk what to do. My dad was more responsive and told me he would try (because my mom absolutely didn’t want to). I just can’t believe that when I finally open up to them they push me away and make me feel like I’m stupid and useless. And Because of this I’ve been getting really dark thoughts and I’m just done lost and don’t know what to do I have other family issues and my mental health is rapidly just dropping. I have support from my boyfriend but frankly it isn’t enough I still feel it the pain everything m’y parents told me the hurt the abuse.

This is my (22M) first time posting here, and I just wanted to share my mental health over the past 5-6 years. It also involves my experience with religious beliefs which eventually influenced my departure from religion. I haven't shared it with anyone I know till now due to the lack of support and gaslighting I was a victim of when I struggled with depression, (as well as the treatment I'm likely to get because of my family's and church's religious dogma). I had no one to open up to and became rather paranoid about people not taking me seriously. So I learned to just... ignore it and try and live with it. It became the new 'normal' for me. But what exactly am I talking about? Let me explain:

6 years ago, in summer 2014 (I was 16), I started having issues with controlling my own thoughts-one thought in particular, to be specific. I imagined what it would be like to breathe while constantly being aware of my inhaling and exhaling. It began as an silly and fleeting joke but I immediately realised what I had gotten myself into. I had problems actually exhaling while noticing myself about to do it because I was struggling to drive that initial thought of no control out of my head. It sounds really bizarre I know...but it became a real issue for me. The more I struggled to exhale and relax, the more the experience cemented that initial thought into my memory and the harder it became to forget it. So it was essentially a cycle I got real stuck in.

As you might imagine, it eventually became visible to others and my mum noticed that I was constantly taking deep breaths, which got her very concerned (the deep breaths were my attempts to relax when exhaling). She asked why I was constantly doing it and I told her. My family are extremely religious (we're fundamentalist Christians but I've become a closet agnostic atheist) and back then we tended to rely more on prayers than seeking medical advice when we should have. My parents prayed but despite all their efforts, nothing changed. 

It got to the extent that there was no period when I could actually relax. I was always out of breath because of constantly having to exhale deeply. I remember it got so bad that one night I was actually struggling to breathe and I was terrified. I tried my hardest to get myself to relax and breathe out but it only got worse and I became even more afraid. After what felt like a good while I was able to finally calm down and fall asleep.

However, this strange experience occurred again and this led to one of the most bizarre experiences of my entire life. I was struggling to exhale and relax like before and it looked like the what happened that night was going to repeat itself and then...I felt something change. Like an actual physical changing of my brain. It's very difficult to describe and it was so strange. I had no idea what was going on at that moment and when it seemed like I was ok again, everything felt... different.

The first thing I noticed was that I was cold. I didn't notice this at all beforehand and neither did I feel cold enough to notice until then. And it wasn't just in that moment either, I was feeling perpetually cold even in school. 

Then more strange stuff started happening. I realised after some days that I couldn't use my inner monologue anymore. Perhaps I thought it was just something minor at the time, but later I realized it was a serious issue. Whenever I tried (and still try) to talk in my head I can't hear anything like I used to be able to. This has made reading, self monologue and expression of thoughts and emotions a real struggle for me as I have, and still do, frequently resort to self talk (narrating my thoughts out loud) in order to process my thoughts and feelings. This is especially the case when I'm in an emotional state (when I'm very angry, sad, hurt, happy, surprised etc.)

The next thing that I can remember was affected was my ability to read. I literally could not make sense of words on the page. I tried to read like I usually do but I just...couldn't. Reading anything suddenly became so hard and it really affected my studies at the time. I've had to teach myself how to read since then.

The most difficult experience to explain was the fact that I had to basically relearn very basic motor function tasks like walking, sitting down, etc. Like reading, it was like I couldn't do it like I used to. The best example of this is actually praying and to a lesser extent, talking. Because of how we were taught in Church, we have a very...different way of praying than most Christians. It's not just a single reciting of a prayer line; we say a certain prayer line repeatedly and we say it with zeal/passion and continue this process for as long as we deem the prayer point (what we're praying about) to be important enough to be prayed about (Very weird I know, it's a Nigerian thing 🤷🏾‍♂️). 

Because I only knew how to pray that way and now found doing so physically impossible (like I literally couldn't say the words) I'd feel very guilty for not being able to pray for long, as I thought God wouldn't answer my prayers. Part of me felt God would understand my situation but the guilt was overwhelming.  


One of the biggest changes however, was my complete lack of interest in anything I previously found enjoyable. Up till then I was really getting into football (referred to as soccer in the US) and was also into Anime and gaming but once that strange Incident occured, no matter how much I tried to get into any of my interests, I felt no excitement or happiness at all. 

The other two biggest things were extreme levels of guilt and anxiety seriously hampering my mental state. I didn't know why but I felt so much guilt for the most insignificant of things (for example, wanting to spend less time than usual brushing my teeth because I found the task too demanding. 

Anxiety I felt especially in school, I didn't have many regular friends and no close friends (partly due to me being socially awkward but mainly because of my religious upbringing and emphasis on not keeping relationships with 'unbelievers' superficial for fear of them 'negatively influencing' you), but even those I sometimes hung out with I suddenly became too nervous to talk to them and definitely too nervous to talk to anyone I didn't know already. It caused me to completely withdraw from everyone I knew outside of the family.


I know it feels like all these things were big warning signs that something was VERY wrong with me, and that I should have gone to see a therapist or psychiatrist ASAP, but at the time all this was happening all at once and it was just too much for me to process. Because these problems arose during my final year of secondary school, each day became so much harder and it felt like I couldn't slow down to just think about what was happening to me upstairs. 

My deeply religious upbringing and my lack of knowledge regarding mental health/illness didn't help. Due to my family being fundamentalist Christians, I believed I must have done something very wrong, and committed sin to deserve the barrage of issues that just suddenly popped up in my life. The fact that I failed in the responsibilities that I was taught was expected of me by God (praying regularly, reading and studying the Bible, preaching to others about the gospel, and staying away from anything 'sinful' like pmo (pornography, masturbation, orgasm) due to all the mental problems I was wrestling with, served to fuel and reinforce the guilt I felt everyday. 

I talked to my mother on two occasions about seeing the GP to explain my experience during my final year in secondary school. Bizarrely, her reply was no. She said it was best that I wait until I finish my Leaving Certificate (the equivalent of A-Level exams which are the high school exams you do prior to leaving secondary school) to deal with it. Now, I think the fact that I was seriously unable to express what I was going through partly led to her lack of urgency towards the issue. Had I been able to pass it across more accurately, perhaps things would've been different. It was a similar situation with my father. I wasn't as close to him and he wasn't as available my mother was on a daily basis. 

Because I had no one that could understand me, I felt very isolated dealing with all this baggage of mental and emotional problems. The build up of stress from these issues caused me to rely on devoting myself even more to living 'right' as I learned from my fundamentalist Christian upbringing. To me, the only way of solving these problems was to confess my sins to God and correct my 'sinful ways'. 

About halfway through the academic year a seemingly minor incident drove me to make this decision. I was wrongly accused of looking at pornography on my phone and was openly rebuked by my parents in front of my siblings and was made by them to fast till 5pm for 3 days as a way of ' 'showing God I was really sorry and getting rid of the evil spirits that had entered me' (This was essentially why they made me did it). As you can imagine, this sparked very intense feelings of guilt and shame in me and I repeatedly expressed the injustice I felt to God in prayer. 

This was why I finally decided to ask for forgiveness and I was thoroughly relieved when I found myself able to just drop pmo entirely and suddenly live the way God wanted me to, despite not deriving any happiness in living this way at all (mainly due to my depression). It was what led me to believe that God had forgiven me and was now helping me to live 'right'. I was, to the best of my ability, praying and reading the Bible regularly, and staying away from 'sinful' things. Nothing about my mental health had changed but I felt that surely now, God would step in and clear out all these inexplicable problems. I had also stopped masturbating; all these changes lasted for a couple of weeks and I felt more relieved than happy about my life and health despite having a miserable experience in dealing with my mental health.

I really felt God was speaking to me and reassuring me that he'd vindicate me, as I still wanted him to long after the punishment was past. But not long after my newfound hope, I had started to relapse back into pornography &amp; masturbation. The newfound hope that I had, was gone and was replaced by a lingering feeling of fear that all my hard work in trying to be a better Christian and get better mentally, was being undone. And no matter how hard I tried I couldn't stop it. 

My stress levels got worse with the increasing workload of study that I had to do, coupled with my poor mental health, which only exacerbated my porn &amp; masturbation habits, and this in turn worsened my guilt as well as my anxiety and fear of losing God and being left alone to tackle my mental health problems.

I remember feeling so guilty after masturbating yet again that I made the very difficult decision of telling my parents. I usually never do this because I always criticised myself for masturbating and beat myself up over it. Having them add their extreme reaction to it and subsequent harsh criticism only ever served to make me feel even worse about myself and put me in a continuous state of self loathing. 

I took the bold step of admitting to my mother out of strong guilt that I did it, expecting her to be more understanding and less harsh on me, because I was being honest, only to be unpleasantly surprised by her reaction. Her face dropped and she didn't at all hide the look of disappointment but instead went to tell my father, which was the last thing I wanted. 

I was beaten with a belt by my dad and desperately trying to tell him that I genuinely wanted to stop doing it but was accused of lying because apparently the 'holy spirit was telling him so'. That has since deterred me from opening up to them about anything to do with masturbation or pornography. 

From then, no matter how much I confessed and asked for forgiveness for 'sinning' against God, or  asked for grace to live 'right', I couldn't stop doing it. The weight of guilt was so hard to bear that I think I ended up convincing myself that the holy spirit knew I was being genuine in my efforts to stop, and would be understanding and tolerant of my addiction, and fully clung to that belief. 

This all changed on one particular evening after doing it and telling myself that excuse once again, all of a sudden I just realised how ridiculous it sounded. I was baffled at how I could believe such a thing and how I'd come to believe it in the first place. Intense fear gripped me immediately I realized the gravity of what I'd done. The fear of the holy spirit leaving me, of God leaving me to suffer at the hands of my problems and the devil. I immediately started asking for mercy, for the holy spirit to come back and help me, for grace to overcome the 'temptation' to do it, the way I was able to but nothing changed.

That was the scariest thing for me back then, to be left alone to handle my problems. I kept trying to convince myself that God would answer me when I'd try and pray again, but after many failed attempts it finally dawned on me that God wasn't answering my prayers for some inexplicable reason. I was still in denial about this being possible, because I knew I genuinely wanted to change but couldn't pray a lengthy prayer due to my struggles with praying. I also knew the bible contradicted this explanation (God not answering prayer of forgiveness, see John 6:37). 

But it was the only valid explanation I could think of at the time and boy was it a scary thing to come to terms with. I didn't know what to do or who to tell about my experience as I didn't have any close Christian friends my age in church (virtually all youth boys apart from myself in my church weren't considered 'born again' so I couldn't make a close friend in church) or at school and my previous experience with opening up to anything 'sin' related to my parents deterred me from ever doing so again. 

Throughout the summer my mental health grew worse but my dad insisted that nothing was wrong with me and that I go to Uni despite me telling him I wasn't ready mentally to take such a step. My mental health grew worse as I started Uni in the UK and the fact that I was too underdeveloped socially and emotionally for life outside the family really didn't help (I had never ever spent time away from the family at all before moving to the UK to study). My anxiety also got worse which made me even more socially awkward and I struggled to fit in and make friends with any classmates or flatmates. 

My depression reached its peak when I began spending more and more time in my room due to my crippling anxiety. Some of those symptoms that I said I was experiencing at the start of this post grew worse, mainly my apathy and anxiety. Fast forward about 7 months to September 2016 and after being close to attempting suicide, gaslighting and bad advice from family on dealing with my depression, and getting kicked off my course, deciding not to get adequate treatment because of my mother wanting to be with me during therapy sessions (which I didn't want but also didn't want unnecessary drama if I spoke out) my parents still insisted that I go to Uni the following year, which I did.


In 4 years since then, a lot of these issues that I described at the start of this post have still been present, including my masturbation and pornography habit, I still don't have my inner monologue and everything still feels... different despite no longer suffering from depression. Happiness, sadness, excitement, these emotions don't feel familiar in the way I expected them to. It all still feels unfamiliar. 

It's only until after overcoming some delusions about life suddenly getting better without me putting any effort in, that I realised I could get help at the University with my mental health which I am currently doing. These symptoms though, are things I haven't spoken to anyone about as I've only recently realised I need to tell someone about them. 

I understand my experiences are specific to my situations but if there's any similarity you see between mine and yours with mental health, please let me know. I haven't been able to make sense of some of them for far too long. Sorry if there's any typos, I just wanted to get this posted ASAP and not postpone it any further. If you have any questions at all feel free to ask.

I'm very confused about if I even want to have friends or not. It's not tempting at all because I find it so distressing to build and keep relationships with others. 

I can't handle the burden it feels like to have someone expect things from me when I struggle so much myself. I also don't like people knowing too much about me, even if I don't have anything to hide.

I'm not sure what a friendship would give me, and I'm very certain I can't offer much in a friendship either. My depression has robbed me of all interest in anything, so it's not like I could find someone with common interests to do stuff with anyways.

I can handle chatting with a chat group online fine, because then I choose freely when I want to participate or not in the conversation, and I don't have to explain myself if I stop talking for a while. 

If anyone tries to speak to me one on one from the chat group I tense up and get really stressed out and just want to stop that conversation as soon as possible.

I have tried making friends before, but I didn't find it rewarding at all and I eventually had to break contact because of the stress it gave me. 

I am going to therapy soon, and I'm concidering anti depressants.

How do you deal with this?","Hi, this probably won't be read but I kind of want to just vent about this somewhere. Recently, I had been targeted on my bus route to work. A guy on the bus became very aggressive towards me - I'm quite timid so I just tried to avoid eye contact and stayed quiet. But he threatened to hurt me, would go from silent to yelling, and said some seemingly schizophrenic (?) things such as ""stop following me"" and ""get out of my head"". Even worse, is he seemed to know what I did for work and that seemed to trigger him as well. After a while he then approached me, and hit me in the head... Yep, time to leave. 

I don't know this man, and his threats were made much worse by him acting on them. He seemed to be triggered specifically by my presence, and that terrifies me. Yesterday I tried to go to work again but he was on the bus, glaring at me. I don't know what to do, I'm constantly anxious I'll be attacked on my way to work, and it's starting to bleed into my nightmares. If this was just a random assault I wouldn't even care, but he had such a huge amount of targeted rage towards me and I don't even know why. I don't know how I should feel - I swing from thinking ""I'm being overly dramatic"" to ""he might kill me"", and at points I'm questioning whether I just made the whole thing up and it was a bad dream.

I have always loved to read and watch films, often, I imagine like most of us choosing films, books and stories that relate and speak to me on some level. Joseph Campbell argued that all stories are really the same, he evaluated a huge range of  cultures and their versions of “once upon a time” and “in a galaxy far far away” and saw that they all followed a common theme. Ultimately at their core there stories follow a similar principal. 

The protagonist, usually the hero lives in the ordinary world and receive a call to adventure. Harry Potters call to adventure is his letters of acceptance to Hogwarts, but if the hero is unable or unwilling to answer the call it often can take a more dramatic streak, Hagrid bursting down the door after Harry has been taken far away, or Luke Skywalker discovering his home has been destroyed. These events though distressing push the hero on their VITAL journey. The hero then often learns from a mentor or others that they possess a special skill, something that separates them from others and has usually made them feel excluded and out of place in the “ordinary world”. The hero then faces various trials and tribulations and learns how to use their power, or finds the treasure or defeats the enemy, rescues the damsel in distress etc, but most importantly the hero returns to his ordinary world again, where he began, but with skills renewed, and a story to tell. Some of the oldest story’s we have are simply tales of someone going on an adventure and bringing nothing back except a story! 

So what’s the relevance in mental health? 

These story’s and films speak to us on an emotional, metaphysical maybe even spiritual level. That means they must bear significance. We are not inspired by story’s for no reason. Story’s often use extreme or fantastical situations and realities to exemplify real and authentic situations in life. If the Hero’s Journey and it’s concept is universal and these story’s inspire us at a base and core level, then maybe they can relate to mental well-being? 

Imagine if you saw your crises and lows possibly even more, psychosis and mania, as points on your journey, with the knowledge that to push on is to further the journey where eventually there must be a return. Not just a return, but a return that the hero has earned, not necessarily achieved alone, but fought for and won primarily by the hero and under their will and strength. It is an interesting point to note that often the hero wins just as things appear their darkest, this is a theme anyone could think of countless examples “it’s always darkest before the dawn”. It is not insignificant that we have written this into the works made to inspire. And so many artist who create these works have experienced dark nights of the soul and breakdowns, overwhelming emotions, addictions and psychoses. Without these experiences they would not be able to speak to, touch and fascinate us as we do. 

An expression I have often found touching and beautiful is the idea of being “made whole again” or “restored”.
A vital part of the Hero’s Journey is that often the hero must loose something, or change or grow in some respect, metaphorically part of them must die to be renewed with something better. It is not without the pain of that spiritual or metaphorical death. That could involve beating down your ego, or learning your not as receptive as you thought you were, or have a selfish streak, facing down anxiety, taking that first counselling session, reaching out socially, going to work, seeing family, addressing issues and past pain and trauma etc etc, the list of human folly and difficulty is endless, the types of pain unique and valid, but with such uniqueness there is always hope, the possibilities are endless as humans are wonderful creative and innovative creatures. Where something is broken we aim to fix, we do often struggle to fix ourselves. 

in films and story’s this can be represented in much more visceral and often metaphorical situations for example:  Raskolnikov in Crime and Punishment murders a women and has to deal with the consequences of that by wrestling his own conscience. We don’t all murder, but we do all wrestle with our conscience from time to time, some might argue to be healthy you must argue with yourself to some degree on a regular basis in order to grow. 

Just as people have more facets than can be recorded and documented, there are stories that describe some aspect of “the human condition”. The truth is, I believe, to be human is filled with events we cannot control, events that are painful and stay with us maybe all our lives. And it is definitely human to be weighed down by them, and even break from or try and escape reality because of them. What’s important is that there is always a journey back. That you remember, even when you cannot feel it that in your darkest moments you may be in the throws of your hero’s journey. It could be your call to adventure telling you to face something. It could be the mentor in the guise of a friend or counsellor or family member or partner who knows. It could be your darkest moment before your dawn. If these stories tell us only one thing it is that the journey continues, no one can predict the future. Not people, not a story, not you or me. It is for this reason that at our lowest I would beg that you consider that this may just be a vital stage in your transformation and that the pain, loneliness, depression, anxiety, suicidality, psychosis, mania, grief, personality, behaviour can all change and no one can say what will work for you. 

If there is little to comfort you, imagine one day comforting someone you can see is going through what you have been through, and knowing you can help them in a way no one else can. 

Because I think there could be more to the Hero’s Journey, and that’s, that not only does the hero inspire with their story. They help others go on theirs, they help. Because eventually the hero is back in the ordinary world, they tell their tail and life resumes, but the journey NEVER ends. Eventually the hero will be called again and travel to another unknown “extraordinary” world and go on another “adventure”. Whilst our “Adventures” might not be as heroic or physical as those in fairytales or films, exploration of the soul and who we are is a valuable journey, one with the power to overcome fear, deal with rejection, forgive, confront, love and so much more. It is a heroic journey like no other. It does mean that there might always be lows, there may always be issues, but at the same time there can ALWAYS be development, hope and change. 

I will conclude this long piece with some quotes and a story. 

“The cave you most fear to enter holds the most treasure” -Joseph Campbell 

“Find a place inside where there is joy, and the joy will burn out the pain.” -Joseph Campbell 

“You must be willing to leave the life you had planned, in order to find the one waiting for you” -Joseph Campbell 

“You enter the Forrest at the darkest point, where there is no path. You are not on your own path. If you
Follow someone else’s way. You are not going to realise your potential” -Joseph Campbell 


My story is that of the Golden Buddha, which can be found exemplified in a documentary called “Finding Joe” all about Joseph Campbell that initially inspired my fascination with the topic. I will post a link to a full version if there are those interested. 

The story is thus: 

There was a golden Buddha outside a monastery and village in Tibet and it was a prized and worshipped and beautiful possession.  One day there was word that the village was going to be taken over and robbed, they knew that the first thing the invading army would see would be the golden Buddha. The villagers decided to cover the Buddha in concrete so that NO VALUE would be seen in it. 

The plan worked. 

Years went by and the village generations moved on and forgot that the Buddha had ever been golden. A young monk is praying at its feet and a small piece of concrete comes off and he sees gold. He goes to tell the villagers and show them. 

Everyone gathers round the Buddha and begin painstakingly pealing and chipping away the concrete. To reveal a beautiful golden Buddha. 

The message: we are all born perfect and without flaw, and events weather they be things that we do, or things that happen to us; our pains and traumas everything, that becomes the concrete. Painful as it is, to realise that some issues may be reduced to no more than concrete that CAN, with work, be chipped away. I can attest, as does the film, that after seeing the gold beneath the concrete, even if only a small portion, it is worth the pain of picking and chipping it away. If that means facing personal demons, battling depression and essentially battling  yourself it’s worth it. 

Maybe, if we looked at ourselves as potential hero’s in the making we could face a whole range of issues and grow in ways we never knew were possible. Because, after all, super powers and miracles were not put in these stories for nothing. Have you never pushed yourself past the point you ever thought was possible? Been braver than you’ve ever been before? Spoken out? Done the right thing when it might damage yourself? Stood up to those who tried to hold you down? Done what’s right even though it was difficult? Done what was courageous even through it wasn’t easy? Faced a demon? All of these. And as I repeat, more. Are heroic! And just because you haven’t done them, doesn’t mean you can’t start. 

And remember, hero’s often fail on several occasions before they are masters of their craft and passion...

Metal wind chimes sang a brief melody as you stepped through the door of a small brick building, isolated from what seemed to be the entirety of civilization. The receptionist’s desk was dimly lit by flickering candles that smelled like vanilla and warm, yellow bulbs that illuminated the hallway down the back. No one was sitting at the desk; in fact, it appeared that dust had started to collect on the polished dark-wood to give it a grey appearance. Cobwebs lied in the corners where the walls met. A stray thought told you to turn around, get back in the car and drive home. You swallowed hard and pushed it away. This was necessary. 

The approaching footsteps of a girl just over three feet tall took you by surprise. The expression on her face had been somewhat blank as she looked up at you, studied you. And you did the same to her. It had been a long time since you’d seen such clear skin, such bright eyes. Pouty lips and chubby cheeks. An undeveloped flat chest and skinny little ankles and wrists. Just as you opened your mouth to say something to her, her expression morphed into recognition and she ran to throw her arms around your torso. You weren’t really that tall anyway. “You’re here!” She exclaimed, excitedly bouncing on her toes a bit. An ounce of her childish happiness was enough to make you smile, and you did, painfully unaware that she was unable to see through your mask. 

“What’s that thing you’re wearing on your face,” the girl asked, her tone fairly judgemental for someone of such a young age. Your brow furrowed in confusion; unsure of what she was talking about, you reached up to feel your nose and lips and realized the young girl was referring to the blue surgical mask on your face. With hesitation, you carefully unclasped the elastic straps from behind your ears and removed the mask completely, already feeling an uncomfortable twisting in your stomach of being in such close proximity to another person without the appropriate protection. “This is a mask,” you replied, biting the inside of your cheek in the middle of your explanation as you tried to figure out how to properly tell her the reality of what was going on. “People are getting really sick, and everyone has to do their part to keep themselves and others safe.” The girl looked at you and crinkled her nose. “But you’re not sick.” A weary smile fell over your lips as you looked down at her. She was right, but at the same time, she couldn’t have been more wrong. “I know I’m not,” you whispered. “Mommy is.” The young girl’s face contorted into one that combined shock, sadness, and pure terror, eyes simultaneously welling with tears and threatening to bulge from their sockets. Her superhero was no longer as invincible as she thought she was. Unable to speak, she could only manage small, choked back whimpers as tears began to fall onto her cheeks. “Come here,” you cooed, crouching down to her level and taking both of her tiny hands in one of your own, thumbing over the smooth skin. “She’s okay, I promise. She coughs sometimes but she’s getting better. She’s getting better,” you repeated once more, unsure if it was to reassure the crying child or yourself. 

Now that your nose and lips were so close on display, you watched as her glassy brown eyes focused in on your fresh nose piercing; she sniffed idly, her brows raising and head tilting in a perfect example of sheer curiosity. “What’s that?” She reached out to touch the silver stud in your right nostril, the sudden contact causing a little sting that you hid through a smile. “That,” you began, speaking softly to the girl. “is the same thing you have in your ears, silly.” You moved to carefully tuck her hair behind one of her ears and take a good look at the pink gemstone stud; they used to be your favorite before you lost them. You forced another smile and blinked away the memory, standing up and stepping back from her. “And this one, too.” The girl gasped and covered her mouth in surprise as you lifted your shirt to reveal another piercing through your belly button. You wiggled it, twisted it around a bit just for show. You could tell it was making her giggle. “It’s so shiny… I want one right now,” she declared proudly, showing off a grin with three missing teeth. That brought a genuine smile to your face for the first time since your arrival; letting your shirt fall, you shook your head and took a seat in a nearby chair. “Come on, miss priss, you’re too little.” You patted your lap invitingly for her to sit with you, and she did as if she was already used to the motion. And she was, you know she was; you used to do it all the time with your father while you were small enough to fit. 

“Do you know how to read?” The little girl asked, leaning over to a nearby bookshelf without leaving your lap and pulling out Dr. Seuss’ *The Cat in the Hat*. Having to stifle a laugh from the sheer genuineness with which she’d asked her question, you hesitated in your response; in that split second of hesitation, she’d already opened the book to the title page and began reading, whispering the words underneath her breath as she waited for any kind of reply from you. Sitting so high on your lap, her feet swung in the air as though she didn’t have a single care in the world. “I do know how to read. And… it seems like you do too,” you commented with a smile. She nodded in response, increasing her volume to begin slowly reading pages to you without you even having to ask. While she read, you thought about how smart she was, how motivated, how hard-working. How she would be in accelerated classes by the time she was eight. Everything would be handed to her until one day, it wouldn’t; burnout would set in and you knew there was no easy way to prepare her for that. You listened as the sweet, tender voice read aloud a series of simple rhyming words that, oddly enough, seemed to bring her joy with every turning page. “The end,” she said as she closed off the back cover of the book with another one of those toothy grins. “What’s your favorite book?” Oh, if she only knew. 

“Uh… honestly, I haven’t really been reading that much anymore,” you admitted, already knowing the reaction that you’d get from her. Her lips curled into a frown, seeming almost disappointed in you. But you saw this coming; in the fourth and fifth grade, she’d be reading and rereading novels for nothing more than her own enjoyment. She’d always love bookstores but stop going because she’d find nothing much interested her anymore. In high school, she’d only be reading for academics alone. “So…” The little girl bit her lip and allowed thick, awkward silence to hang in the air for longer than what would be socially acceptable. “What *do* you do, then?”

“I like to write things,” you answered truthfully, after a moment’s hesitation. Exhaling a quiet sigh, you forced another small smile onto your lips and gave the girl’s hand a gentle squeeze. “Maybe I can write something for you to read when you’re older. How does that sound?” She nodded in response, absently chipping away at the blue nail polish on your short, bitten fingernails. And you just let her, because you honestly didn’t have the heart to tell her no. “And I play volleyball.” That part was a lie; you quit four months ago. The sport had been so engrained into your personality that it slipped out without you even thinking about it. The girl furrowed her brow. “What about gymnastics?” You chuckled quietly and shook your head. “No, not anymore… the gym shut down, remember?” Of course she didn’t. It hadn’t happened yet. And even if the gym had stayed open, it would be unlikely that you’d have continued with it anyway. It had been a long time since you’d seen your body in anything other than a sweatshirt and sweatpants two times your size; just the thought of a leotard was enough to make you faint. 

The girl hadn’t been listening much and it was obvious that her attention had shifted onto something new. She had lifted up she sleeve of your sweatshirt and was currently examining the discoloration on your wrist and forearm; long slits of red were combined with bruisy hues of purple and brown and green. You could already feel tears stinging at your eyes, threatening to fall without her having said anything yet. Her eyes grew round and sympathetic as she looked up at you, then down to your wrist, then up again. “**What happened to you?**”

It was that question, that fucking question alone that started the cascade of tears that you weren’t sure you’d be able to stop. It was a question you asked yourself every time you looked in the mirror, it was a question your parents asked you after you didn’t complete the chores as they asked, and it was a question your teachers were probably thinking, but didn’t ask when they saw your abundance of missing assignments. But she was so compassionate, so sweet. There was no trace of malice in the way she looked at you or your injuries. She just wanted to help you, but you knew that was her fatal flaw; she was always willing to help everyone else, yet never able to help herself. You pulled your sleeves down over your hands and used them to wipe away the tears on your face, trying desperately to breathe yet each exhale came out as a heaving sob from deep within your chest. “I’m sorry, I—I don’t know what’s going on,” you whimpered, your face and chest growing physically warm as your breaths began to quicken. At this point, you were sure that you looked completely and utterly pathetic to the young girl whose eyes were  as round as marbles as she stared at you. It was only a second later that she made herself more comfortable in your lap and wrapped her arms around your neck, squeezing tightly. “Don’t… cry,” she whispered hesitantly, stroking your hair in the way your mother used to. You knew that was where she got it from. And that was all it took; you began to focus more on the light fragrance of her baby powdered skin than the throbbing in the back of your head or the dangerously rapid beating of your heart. She held you like that for a few minutes until you’d calmed down and were breathing normally; it was only then that you were able to wrap your arms around her as well, gently and carefully rocking her in your lap as a calming motion for the both of you. You leaned in to press a kiss to her temple. “I love you,” you whispered against her skin. She squeezed you a little tighter. “You, too.”

There were a few minutes of comfortable silence between the two of you; neither of you attempted to break it because somehow, it just felt necessary. It felt right. 

The sun was beginning to set, creating a golden glow through the pale windows of the room. You’d always loved sunsets; the little girl already seemed so fascinated with the changing colors of the sky. “You can go watch it if you’d like. I think… I think I’m going to head back home.” Her head whipped around from the window to look back at you and she shook her head, clutching fistfuls of your shirt as an attempt to keep you there forever. “Please don’t go,” she whined sadly, her eyes glassing over once again. You lifted the girl up off of your lap and set her atop the desk so that you could look at her fairly eye level. “I’ll be back, pretty girl,” you reassured softly, looking the girl in the eyes. You saw yourself in her reflection, quite literally. But you didn’t think much of it because you knew there would be more to come during the next session. This was just the beginning. You turned to grab your keys and phone, offering the child another somber wave before heading out of the door and finally allowing the tears to flow freely. The walk back to your car was long, and chilly; you breathed into your hands to keep them warm until you could get your car to heat up. Taking a deep breath and a quick glance into the rear view mirror before backing out, you noticed the small building had been replaced by sparse trees, as though… as though it were never there. She was gone until she knew you’d need her again.",mentalhealth,2021-01-26 08:25:45

However, i first started truly noticing it when I’d ask my friends if everything feels blurry and like a dream at school. They’d say no. Along with this I became severely depressed but never spoke about that side of things. ‘Severe anxiety’ is what i got diagnosed with because my local GP would just say that dissociation is a coping mechanism of anxiety. Yes i got anxious at times but feeling not alive was the most concerning thing to me. I would go on holidays but it felt like i never went, just as if i had watched a film before of it and they weren’t my memories. 
Anyway, my point is every doctor, counsellor and therapist I’ve ever spoken to about this doesn’t take me seriously. I cant stress enough how numb and naturally high i feel. I guess i began to make things worse for myself recently and completely gave up with trying to get help. I don’t say no to smoking weed, doing ketamine and getting drunk anymore. In fact its almost everyday. Of course this makes me feel ten times more dissociated each day but I don’t know what to do anymore. No friends around me know of this, my mum is aware but its difficult for someone to understand when they don’t feel it themselves. I don’t get phases of dissipation, i feel like this 24/7 from the moment i wake up to the moment i go to bed. In fact my dreams feel somewhat clearer to me than real life. 
Does anyone know any mediations or anything that genuinely works in feeling grounded or alive for them. If anyone has tips I’m wiling to turn my life around and try and help myself seeing as no one else will, but i need to know that its possible first otherwise i guess ill just see how long i can manage feeling like this.

The main reason why is that my boyfriend from within the group broke up with me. I couldn’t cope with the mean reactions from some others in the group and reacted quite emotionally. I ended up taking my distance from the group; they refused to let me back in when I ended up feeling lonely and my now ex falsely reported my Discord account so it would get deleted. This hurt me a big ordeal and I feel like he didn’t take any responsibility for his actions. I ended up losing lots of chats of people who are not in my life anymore and friends I only knew from Discord.

I made a deal with one of those friends whom I still talk to to leave them alone for a month since they didn’t want to solve it and giving them space might work out.

But now, everything is different. I was raped this Saturday and feel extremely confused, hurt and weirded out by all that happened. I’m in need for support, even if it’s just playing stupid small games with that group of friends. I need them more than ever and am left wondering if I should stay distant or if I should reach out. I don’t want to annoy them by reaching out when they needed space but at the same time, I’m going through something that - in my opinion - overrules all the childish bullshit that happened beween us.

I really need some opinions. Should I inform them about what happened and that I could really use being back allowed into the group or should I stay away and remain alone with whatever I’m feeling?",mentalhealth,2021-01-26 08:38:36

I'm a self-employed artist (stage and film, in different capacities), and I place a lot of my self-worth and my sense of identity in what I achieve through my work. However, I always seem to self-sabotage. There comes a point in a project where I shy away from the work, from the effort, the difficulties and the steadfastness required.  
So the repeating pattern is this:

\- I'm out of a job/looking for one.  
\- A great (and I mean unique) opportunity falls into my lap. One which others would be very grateful for.  
\- I accept the challenge of the project, even though I have huge self-doubt - but precisely because I believe I should push myself out of my comfort zone.  
\- I take on the project. But soon I start shying away from the challenge, start seeing the flaws in my work, my intellect, and my capacity for empathy and sensitivity.  
\- I start hiding from my colleagues, I go quiet. Disappear from the playing field. I get the feeling I have never understood the work at hand itself.  I wish I could just slink out the back door.

I also feel like I'm trapped in self-observation, instead of being in the moment. I exist in a parallel, self-reflexive world.

Both my attitude to the work, to the opportunity, as well as the fact that I am aware of it make me ashamed, embarrassed. Also the fact that I make it all (reality) about me. That makes me ashamed as well.

My colleagues, because of the culture I live in, do not confront me about my shortcomings, they are silent about it. They must wonder what the hell is wrong with me.

Do I need people to tell me off to feel good? Do I need them to tell me that I have worth? How can I break this way of thinking, of being? What can I do?",mentalhealth,2021-01-26 09:08:06

i actually dislike being inside the house. on weekends, i secretly hope for a chance to go outside — even if it’s just to a family relative. staying at home reminds me of the things i can’t do, those dark thoughts, and the fact that i’m doing terrible at online school. the first two months of the academic year was fine. i was actually doing my work even if it left me fatigued at night. i did my responsibilities even though i knew that i would only have an hour or two to myself every day. i’m now in the beginning of the third semester, and the moving up ceremony is less than 2 months away. i feel terrible that i can’t get my shit together. i failed 3 classes so far in the first semester, and i think i’m failing at least two in second semester. i can’t focus on the hour-long sessions that i have, and i would usually end up with a slight pain in the head in the afternoon. my back would also hurt. i would also be fatigued even though i would have days wherein i was unproductive.

not only that. i’m starting to feel really insecure about my weight. in fact, i only consume about 2 meals a day. egg and tuna sandwich paired with a healthy juice in the morning, and then eating a late lunch/early dinner with food such as meat or salmon. it’s all healthy and great for diet. at night, i would consume at most 2 cups of green tea. it’s enough for me. however, there’s this voice in my head saying that i needed to eat less because i feel like my mom is secretly judging me. and now, eating around 3 meals make me feel disgusted and disappointed. 

i talked to my mom about this, and she genuinely thinks this whole thing is just mental stress. it’s frustrating, but at least she doesn’t lash out on me for saying that i was being a “whiny bitch”. she thinks it’s all going to magically disappear once summer break rolls around. how cute. i wish that was the case though. anyways, that’s all i have for this lengthy post. i just needed someplace to share my feelings.",mentalhealth,2021-01-26 09:54:23

I know teenagers like to say they have depression a lot and they’re probably right but unfortunately some do do it for attention and i’m not trying to have anxiety for attention 

School starts in one day (Australia stuff), I have no friends to go to. 1 of my friends continuously ditches me, 1 wants to hang out with her boyfriend, and the others hang out with methheads so, no.

The school has 2 friend groups 
- the eshays (smokers, drug users) 
- the popular, smart (and, not or) sporty and mean bitchy rich snobs 
I don’t want to be friend with either of them - there’s no peoples alike me. 
I also am starting my first job next Saturday which I’m really scared for but proud of myself for being successful and pushing through the interview.  This is rambling I know but thank you if you’re reading this.

I’ve given up at this point, I wanna sit in a quiet spot at the library and just play games on my phone, but I have to avoid every teacher I know because I don’t want them to see me by myself all the time so that’s stressful - I kind of hate my life and all this stress is taking over, due to my ocd spiral last year I made bad decisions and now all my teachers hate me, my friend hacked my Instagram and now every student hates me. 
At this point lunchtimes are much more stressful than actual class. But I still remember - people have it much worse than me.

Everyone hates me, I have no one to go to and I’m really stressed - I hate school, I know everyone “hates” school but I really do and it makes me wanna die. I’m also pretty sure I have ptsd from when teachers yell at me which I think it’s triggered from my social anxiety. Heart palpitations and just full distraction from everything around me when I think about it.
It’s not that easy to make friends, but it apparently is according to my mum. 

Tdlr; No one believes my social anxiety, and I have no one to go to at school",mentalhealth,2021-01-26 09:56:25

My brain keeps on tricking me. When I was young I was convinced that shit wasnt real. Like people? nah theyre just robots yk? And I was just in some sort of simulation. That feeling has mostly gone away but comes but time to time.  
Cause of some shit that happened in primary school I was genuinely convinced that no one could ever want to form a close relationship of any sort with me, I found out a year or two ago that that was all bs but I'm still recovering from the lack os social interaction I had when growing up because of it. (still growing my basic social skills and all that)  
Now it SEEMS to be this illusion of ""everyone hates me"" or at least most do. I'm genuinely convinced that basically all of my friend groups hate me or dislike me behind my back and are too nice to say it. I think this is because of stuff in primary school which I had a similar experience in. But then again maybe that is an illusion as well  
I'm just not sure what to believe anymore, what if the people around me do hate me, what if they dont but I believe they do. I honestly just wanna cut myself off from everyone except for a few close friends and isolate myself from everyone else. Why does my mind love to trick me?",mentalhealth,2021-01-26 10:25:14

I have been on and off anti depressants and diagnosed with for around a year but have had depressive thoughts since i was 11-12, i had a pretty crappy home situation and just thought ""id feel better when we moved out"" i did move. It did nothing, then became the realization i was gay, ""ill feel better when i come out"" spoiler alert. I didnt. I got rid of everything seemingly wrong in my life and got nowhere with it, still feeling the same hopelessness and unsatisfaction with life. Within the past year lr so its gotten worse, suicidal thoughts (and unbeknownst to most, actions) are what led me to go on antis. They helped for a bit then seemed to make it drastically worse. Both times. Then came the withdrawals. Basically what im getting at is ive been off antis for a couple of months not that i felt they made much of a difference, and havent been seeing a therapist. I feel so worthless and lost and am about to begin year 12. (Senior year in australia) i have suicidal thoughts, mainly at night sometimes so intense that i get very close to, i dont know, attempting to attempt i guess you'd call it. I want to book an appointment with my doctor tomorrow or the day after to possibly begin antis because i dont know what else i can try. Im worried thouh as im currently suicidal about taking them because i know from my past experience with them that the suicidal thoughts can get worse before theyre better. I dont want to risk that. I want to be honest enough with my gp so as i can discuss the concern but dont want to be hospitalized. Im wondering, in your opinions if i seem 'severe' enough that a doctor would want to hospitalize me if i told them the extent of my thoughts or if im overreacting. And i was also wondering if anyone knows Is it hard to get admitted in Melbourne Aus? Does anyone have experience? Or does it happen at the slightest hint you might commit suicide?

I was moderately stable on meds but they made me so tired I could barely function so I decided to try and go off meds....that went super duper bad. So i started back up with some of my meds, the ones that only make me a little tired, but it's not enough. 

I feel like I'm dying inside. I desperately want to be awake and present to see my daughter grow up, I already miss so much because I'm disassociated so often. But I also dont want my kid to grow up in a home with an inconsistent parent who is off kilter alot of the time. 

I talked to my doctor yesterday and told her everything was good, and then emailed her later to spill my guts that I'm still having problems, I just, for whatever reason, didnt remember them when we talked. Super embarrassing. 

So now I dont know what to do. Should I go back on meds and sleep through my life as a zombie with little emotion (I love feeling love for my daughter, when I'm medicated that internal feeling, along with all of them, go away)? Should I keep trying to cope unmedicated even though I still struggle with delusions, hallucinations and manic episodes? 

I've tried pretty much all the meds they typically prescribe for this stuff and the only effective ones have horrible side effects. I'm ""fine"" unmedicated,  safe to myself and my family, I never get aggravated or violent or even upset, I'm just kind of all over the place. If anything, I spend most of my time manic and upbeat and on top of the world, but not in a healthy way. The biggest problem i have is being extremely paranoid people are trying to break in the house, i got a security system that helps, but i still trip out. I also cant be trusted with money. 

I miss having stable mental health so badly. I still remember what it was like before all this got so overwhelming. I miss being unmedicated and stable and I want that back, but it's never coming back. What should I do? How do I decide if meds are worth it or not? 

I was hoping to return to work in a sheltered workshop (I have other disabilities) but if I get back on meds theres no way I could do that. But I fear that if I stay without meds I'll just keep going further down the rabbit hole. My family and doctor are supportive of my choice whatever it is because I'm not a danger to myself or others either way, it's just me who suffers. My family is kind of concerned for me, but they like having me back to being awake and participating in family stuff so it's a tough call.

I had my house raided by 8 police officers due to me downloading indecent images. I had started when I was 15 looking at girls of my own age and maybe a bit younger since I was curious. I would do it once every 2-3 months when I felt down and lonely and then I would delete the photos/videos after looking at them. Anyhow, I am not attracted to kids or anything and I am most certainly not a pedophile. I have autism and a compulsive disorder and clinical depression (I had the depression before the situation occured and found out about the autism recently) I did not recieve the actual help I needed for my depression and they did not do a full assement of me. I’m in a bit of a weird situation because I have possibly castrated myself (made myself infertile) using hormone pills and injections since the police and the consequences of this situation have made me feel like I am some sort of threat to people. I am not a bad looking guy or anything like I have had a lot of girls try and talk to me and even touch me in public but I have always struggled with girls and would always reject them even If I liked them. I have just struggled a lot with my depression and porn addiction and I feel like I have really been let down by the mental health team where I am based. Infact I actually recentley told them about my situation and yet I am still not getting any help they just call on the phone and listen to me lol. Anyhow, I will be assed by medical experts which my family has to pay for because the public healthcare is a joke. Also, we have hired a defence lawyer for my situation because without one I would literally be screwed. I just think overall it’s a crappy situation since at the age of 18 I can be subject to be in the press if my court case goes public. I was also partly sexually abused when I was younger by a friend. I was looking at the consequences basically I assume I will get 5 years on the sex offenders regsitry. It’s not good because I would never be able to get a job and whenever I want to travel abroad I need to let the police know and I cannont be around children for more then 12 hours without telling the police. It’s embarassing because the police can come over if I have a partner and they can tell them that I am on the sex offenders registry I am not even sure If I would be able to get a girlfriend. I did want to kill myself on mutiple occasions and I still do I am not sure how I can live like this when the record is for life even after the five years is gone I will still never be able to get a job.

We’re all depressed because of our jobs or lack thereof, because COVID is restricting our hopes and plans for the future, and because we’re all so far apart. 

I can’t keep asking people how I can better support them, because I know they’re exhausted, but I don’t know what else to do. If what I’m doing right now to support them is falling short, how do I improve or keep loving them and being a good friend if I can’t ask them to help me help them? 

I have depression too, so I understand exactly how frustrating it can be to have people keep asking you to explain and to do things for them to help them understand, and how exhausting that can be. 

It just feels like I’m stuck between a rock and a hard place though, because I’m getting worse because they’re getting worse, and that means they don’t reach out or support me, and it just seems like a vicious spiral towards lost friendships or broken relationships. I’m trying really hard to avoid that, but I don’t know how long I can keep reaching out without anyone giving me back what I need, but I don’t want to lose anyone or leave anyone feeling abandoned.

I started the c25k program in Nov 2020. I mainly just wanted to jog 5k, and I've failed out of the program before.

But I also wanted to do it rather...Ironically. I think we're all aware how often people suffering from mental health struggles are quite often told to just go outside for air, or exercise. You see those posts here every single day, along with the usual barrage of them being told, quite plainly, it doesn't help.

I took it a step further. 

I've completed the C25K program, a little jogging app the structures jogs each week to help beginners build the foundations for jogging. From a purely physical standpoint, I do recommend it for people who want to jog but don't know where to start, but,

Everyday I wasn't jogging, I walked outside. I've completed my fitbit stepcount nearly everyday for 3 months. That's a little over an hour's worth of walking outside every single day. Day, night, whenever, I'd do it.

Physical results: Dropped 45lbs in 3 months. Can jog 5.5km at a 7m30s pace. Face lost a little fat.

Mental results: No positive change noted. In fact, a mild step back in mental health. No matter how many times I posted I knee I wouldn't feel any different if I did it didn't prepare me for the void of emptiness that I truly felt after completion. My mental health is no different than when I started, and having a slightly healthier body did not impact it in any meaningful way.

I'm also not done. While I've completed my first primary goal on this journey (relevant profile), there are still other goals to meet. I want to achieve the best physical condition I can, if only to further demonstrate that exercise doesn't do a god damn thing for a vast majority of mental health issues, and I feel this viewpoint will only be taken more seriously as I continue to become fit. 

That's not to say it's all hopeless. If you're suffering from mental health issues, please seek professional help. I firmly believe that mental health issues are the results of a ""poisoned mind"", and require treatment and care in the same fashion a critical injury would. You cannot will a laceration to stop bleeding, and I don't think you can will away depression either. We could all use professional help.

Jogged 5.6km without stopping.,"And I guess I'm posting it here cause I need to vent, and maybe advise.

I started the c25k program in Nov 2020. I mainly just wanted to jog 5k, and I've failed out of the program before.

But I also wanted to do it rather...Ironically. I think we're all aware how often people suffering from mental health struggles are quite often told to just go outside for air, or exercise. You see those posts here every single day, along with the usual barrage of them being told, quite plainly, it doesn't help.

I took it a step further. 

I've completed the C25K program, a little jogging app the structures jogs each week to help beginners build the foundations for jogging. From a purely physical standpoint, I do recommend it for people who want to jog but don't know where to start, but,

Everyday I wasn't jogging, I walked outside. I've completed my fitbit stepcount nearly everyday for 3 months. That's a little over an hour's worth of walking outside every single day. Day, night, whenever, I'd do it.

Physical results: Dropped 45lbs in 3 months. Can jog 5.5km at a 7m30s pace. Face lost a little fat.

Mental results: No positive change noted. In fact, a mild step back in mental health. No matter how many times I posted I knee I wouldn't feel any different if I did it didn't prepare me for the void of emptiness that I truly felt after completion. My mental health is no different than when I started, and having a slightly healthier body did not impact it in any meaningful way.

I'm also not done. While I've completed my first primary goal on this journey (relevant profile), there are still other goals to meet. I want to achieve the best physical condition I can, if only to further demonstrate that exercise doesn't do a god damn thing for a vast majority of mental health issues, and I feel this viewpoint will only be taken more seriously as I continue to become fit. 

That's not to say it's all hopeless. If you're suffering from mental health issues, please seek professional help. I firmly believe that mental health issues are the results of a ""poisoned mind"", and require treatment and care in the same fashion a critical injury would. You cannot will a laceration to stop bleeding, and I don't think you can will away depression either. We could all use professional help.

What I -am- trying to say is, if all you're going to do for someone who is turning to you at a time of great personal struggle and mental weardown and needs your support is tell them to ""just go outside for fresh air lol"" then just shut up.

Cause quite frankly, I can jog farther than you. Your advice didn't help in the slightest, and never will, and I've thus far put in the time and effort to prove that.

For liking someone so much and then you found out that they’re not even real?


I met this “guy” online. We were talking ever since then, constantly. He knew everything about me, my mental illness, my traumas, everything and I thought I knew his too. We shared stories together. Although I doubted him for he’s too good to be true, I risked still. He was there at my lowest and he always lifts me up. I was really happy. We were in a phase of what you call unlabeled relationship. It goes on for a year. I was my happiest when I’m talking to him. He sends pictures, videos even, and voice messages. We share phone calls together that’s why I never doubted that he isn’t real. That he’s a fake. That the guy I fell in love with doesn’t exist.  

Last night, he texted me.. saying “I have to tell you something..” I was curious so I asked him what it was.. “ You might despised me because of this..” As he goes on, I get anxious and urged him to tell me what the heck it was all about. He told me that he was lying about his identity, that that guy never existed. I was so confused and angry for being lied to, I bombarded him with questions. He told me his pictures were edited to make it look like it and that he wasn’t even a guy to begin with. It was a girl masquerading as a guy with all he pictures photoshopped so flawlessly to look like a guy. I asked about all the voice messages, the phone calls, the videos, and why even “his” niece and nephews calling him uncle and his “brother” calling him brother. “He” told me that she just set it up like that.. those phone calls, those voice messages and those videos well all edited. That “he” was using voice changer to make it sounds like a guy. I felt like a fool but I can’t hate “him” because I loved “him” truly, I can’t hate her for doing it to me, for fooling and playing me. She said she was sorry and she was feeling guilty this whole time.. she said she had reasons and she didn’t really mean it like that...  And no matter what her reason might be.. I can’t truly hate her and get mad at her and it pains me more. 

I am suffering from an intolerable stress and pain that I can’t even share to any of my friends. She made me of a fool. It triggered every mental illness I had.. I am having breakdowns after breakdowns and I had no means of releasing this suffering I’m currently feeling.. I wanted to do self harm but I already promised myself that I would stop and will never ever do that again. That is why I am posting it here, if you don’t mind.. I just needed a place to vent, in a way, I could release if not all, a portion of it.",mentalhealth,2021-01-27 10:18:48

These past 2.5 years have been the most joyful with the arrival of my first child yet so painful with how people have treated me and tragic family events. I’m not sure how to cope. 

2018- pregnant and joyful ! Yet the same night my husband and I found out we were pregnant, he was showing me his phone and a girl messaged him on fb. I opened the chat right in front him and there was no history of a chat. She said he had messaged the wrong person. So I left it alone. 

2019 - I gave birth to our child. It was very traumatic. The midwife was so rude to me, she told me I looked sloppy and I need to clean myself up. I ended up having csection because I was so defeated in the moment. My girl was born healthy. 
Prior to giving birth, when we announced the pregnancy to my in laws they were literally disappointed. And the only reason why is because they don’t think people should have children because of their religion. They literally, I kid you not, heavily sighed in sadness. They were mean to me my entire pregnancy. From talking smack about me, insulting me, kept touching me when I asked them not too, kept telling me hideous things they’d do to my child once she was born. Told me I was ugly etc. it was bad. I cut things off with them a lot and I stay away from them as much as possible for almost a year now. 

2020- covid hit and I lost my job, it was the best job I had paying $120k base salary + my $20k bonus. I was unemployed for 8 months. The great outcome of that was I got to spend time with my daughter and raised her myself. I recently got a new job in December with a even higher salary. I also lost my grandma in April 2020. It was extremely sad because it was in the heights of covid and she died alone in her nursing home with no family around her. Then in August 2020, I got a random message on IG and found out my husband was sexting her. She was nice and told me the truth, sent me screenshots. Since then we’re physically separated. We live in the same house because of covid and a young child. 

Now 2021, I lost my second grandma. She was the only grandparent I have left. I am extremely close and lived with both my grandmas growing up for several years. The death of my grandma cause the family to rip apart and everyone hates each other. So now I’ve lost cousins, aunts and uncles because of this. Some cousins even blocked me online, without telling me what I did to them. On top of this, I love my job but I miss my baby so much. My plan was to be a samh until baby was 3-4 years old so I can raise her. But this backfired when I decided not to be with my husband. Right now we still live together but sleep in separate rooms. I feel so stressed out about everything that has happened to me, sometimes I don’t eat, I can’t sleep and I’m trying my best to concentrate. I have no friends I can talk to.",mentalhealth,2021-01-27 10:26:41

Anyways. 

My house was a mess I looked like a hoarder there was hella undone dishes, everything was a disaster as far as my home goes. So I’ve been working on that, hard and it has been hard to get the motivation too. *one thing I’ve been trying to consistently keep in mind is - I can do anything for five minutes, even if it seems like it will be the worst or most boring five minutes of my life, it’s just 5 minutes. So maybe if you’re wanting to keep a habit or work on a hobby or get clean, you can do anything for five minutes, you got this*

Also, having been cleaning a lot recently and getting rid of a ton of stuff and rearranging furniture, etc. I’ve watched a lot of decluttering, organizing, and minimalism type videos on YouTube, don’t let that sh*t get to you, use them as tips and advice but not a guide, you don’t have to sell all your stuff, selling your stuff online takes a lot of time and effort and is very stressful, you don’t have to do that, just donate it. One thing my sister told me recently is, you can get a storage unit, she didn’t give me reasons I could get a storage unit she just told me why she has one: to store keepsakes and anything she still loves but cannot keep at home right now due to having a little one. Just knowing that “I can get a storage unit if I want to” has really given me some peace of mind. part of the reason I am cleaning so much is so I can find a smaller home or get an rv because I want to live somewhere where I don’t have to have a roomate to be able to afford it and be able to support myself without food stamps or occasionally asking my parents for help, and knowing that if I do get an rv I CAN keep my vintage dresser that I love and I CAN keep those nightstands that I searched the web for hours to find the “perfect” ones. 

Idk, those two things have really been helping me get by recently so if they can help you too, then let them:

“I can do anything for five minutes”
“I can get a storage unit at some point if I want to”

I’m making loads of plans, ideas and trying to take on workloads of admin and then swinging to crying tragically and considering the unspeakable. I hate it. I hate myself.

I’m chronically ill and the stress is triggering responses also which is impacting my routine. I’ve been in bed all week and managed to wash myself today in the shower. I’m not sleeping much but being compliant with the Quitiapine (200mg) and Lactimal (low dose of 150).

I presented to the psychiatrist in November/December as ‘good” and stable and I agreed I felt on top of stuff; and was discharged. Now I’m not sure what to do. If I’m honest I’ve not felt comfortable with the phone calls due to paranoia of things being recorded. My paranoia becomes too intense and I’m fed up of making poor decisions due to my mental state. Which then stops my progression. I’m pretty sure a gp referral will take 18 months or more...(NHS) no money for private...can I still communicate with my psychiatrist even after discharge? Write a letter perhaps or is that just a really bad idea? Do I just call a hotline? At the same time I don’t trust anyone and am even second guessing if I can post this in good faith.

The anxiety, depersonalization-derealization and many more disorders, which were the result of my traumas, messed with me a lot.

Nowadays I feel way better than in my past and I feel in generel way more positive towards my own life (I'm 18 now). 

Now here is the weird part: Before always when I was socilising with others, I sort of put on a persona without me actively noticing it due to the people pleasing. I wouldn't have any boundaries for myself and I'd see the needs of others as my own needs. When I started realising that I was putting on personas, my mind basically made it even more difficult for me to socialise with others. Depending on the person and the topics, my body and mind would get really exhausted and I'd get really bad headaches. Even if I'd forget the time when talking with a person (which indicates that I enjoy their company ig, which then again is really rare) these effects would still occur. If the topic is superficial like you'd just be talking about events, people or perhaps just basic opinion-sharing, a headach would appear shortly afterwards... Same happens when having to do small talk lol. Sharing ideas and being able to get creative is something which makes myself feel alive. 

I feel bad for the people that I care about, who want to spend time with me, because me setting up boundaries for myself would mean, that when starting a convo I'd very soonish tell them that I feel exhausted and have to leave. I don't want these people to think that I despise them but I simply am not capable of socilising for more than a few minutes without me getting physically and mentally drained. I know I shouldn't feel bad for putting up boundaries because the right people would understand me but it's just weird being this way since it's very uncommon ig? Idk lol.

I also struggle with depression, anxiety and ADHD. I've been through a decent amount of therapy and have ways that I cope. I am in a LDR with a man who is going through a ton of things right now, including depression and anxiety.

He's told me some of what is going on, but definitely not all of it. His communication has dropped, he's stopped saying he loves me, he's stopped saying goodnight, etc.

Are there any of you that do this when you are depressed? I can only imagine it has to do with a feeling of numbness to all feelings in general, or a feeling of not even having love for yourself let alone another person.

Also, I don't always know how to be there for him. I tend to do a lot of active listening- ""You must be exhausted!"" ""What are you feeling right now?"" ""How do you feel about that?"" And I wonder sometimes if that can get annoying or could make someone want to clam up more. I've told him I can just shut up and listen if he wants, that I wouldn't judge him. Is the active listening thing cheesy and annoying?

I know ultimately I will want to talk to him about all of this, but I still feel so shut out right now so I am trying to just be patient and take care of me right now.

To preface, i’m 16, and have been diagnosed with depression by a professional since freshman year. I got a job recently and work saturday’s and sundays, so a good chunk of my free time is taken up by that, and it’s not a bad job, i like it, they pay above minimum wage, it’s nice. I’m also starting act prep, which is tutoring 2 hours a week+work for the rest of the week. Meaning, i don’t really ever get to see my friends. Today, i cried because my art teacher wouldn’t let me paint my fish for my still life(which, makes sense) but idk why i cried over it?? I know for a fact that if covid obviously wasn’t a thing, and i was in person, seeing my friends daily, i wouldn’t feel this way but i honestly feel like shit. not to mention my eating disorder trying to creep its way back in. So, it’s just...a lot right now? I don’t want to quit my job because when i go to college it’ll look GREAT+when i go to get my first job in the professional world it’ll also look good. Sorry to burden you all, i hope you have a great day.

I've been thinking lately, if someone has ADHD, how exactly does it differ if the same person at some point in their lives developed depression? I do know people diagnosed with ADHD often develop depression.

I'm just really confused, because I was recently diagnosed with depression, although I'm slightly suspecting I might just have or also have ADHD, but I'm not sure how to bring it up with my psychologist without me feeling dumb about it.

This is where true magic happens.

Having structures and methodologies is a great way to assist our intention…

While one’s progresses along with the” levels of consciousness” it’s discovered that there’s a will within the individual that will spontaneously guide the entity in the right place at the right time doing the right thing with extreme cutting-edge precision.

We often think that we’re unintelligent, not worthy of this, or not worthy of that…

So we depend on structures, paradigms, like ""personal development"" in order to make us feel “good”.

The truth is that we’re already and always perfect.

When we realize this we’re at home.

One with our Infinite Potential.

Just published a video on the topic… here me and my friend Dave we’ll talk about the levels of consciousness and how to transcend them, join us:

   First off, English is my third language and I've only been learning it for 4 years (mainly through series, movies, and Ytb videos) and I'm sure there will be multiple parts of this will be incomprehensible, so feel free to ask me to rephrase anything you don't understand! and sorry in advance.

   So I've kind of been self-reflecting during the day because of some nasty stuff that was being said about me around school (getting called autistic, fake depressed, or weird) and it led me to realize just how weird I am (I'm not relating this in any way to autism and such, was just trying to figure out why ppl didn't like me and realized some stuff about myself ) 

 For example, in class, I'm always sitting in a corner on my own and talk extremely rarely, I always feel very backward and self-conscious about my body and face and overthink everything, every time I try talking to someone I start stuttering really bad and lose my balance (if I'm standing) , when people make jokes it usually takes me time to understand the point of it which led me to always pretend I'm giggling every time I think someone just made one, it makes me look really fake and superficial when the person wasn't making a joke or if they hadn't finished it yet and I'd already started laughing. I'm usually just staring through the window even tho there's nothing happening since my town is very new and empty so there's barely anyone in the streets, I get mesmerized by the view of the tree leaves flowing along with the wind, stray dogs passing by or even the sight of the dust on the window, it makes concentrating in class difficult since that's (staring through the window) what I'm doing half of the time.  I get frustrated incredibly easily (it could be as simple as someone accidentally brushing against my table while passing by or the teacher not saying ""good job"" after checking out my homework when I was expecting them to) and start agressively skribbling on my notebook until I destroy the page and get weird looks from my classmates even tho I try to be as discrete as possible. I frequently get intrusive thoughts (say at least once every 5mins) of past trauma or visions or (sometimes very vivid) disgusting stuff in general  And to get rid of them I hit my head or shake it rapidly from left to right.  
When I'm walking out of class I always instinctively walk along the nearest wall like I'll stick to it while I'm walking as if I would fall if I didn't. When I'm in gym class or outside school, I'm always as far from others as possible and just sit on the hard floor and stare at the various crevasses and holes on the ground for the rest of the hour instead of playing soccer or basket ball with the others. When anyone gets too close to talk to me I flinch and back off.

   I'd never realized all of this before.

   Does anyone relate to some of the things I described and what do you think is the cause of it all? I'm also kind of frustrated because since I'm always alone and shy some people tend to try to talk to me thinking they're doing charity work by keeping me company when I'm very comfortable being on my own. Tbh I would really appreciate their company if most of them weren't conservative bigots who look down on me because of my sexuality.

Especially now we are back in lockdown.

Me and my boyfriend talk on both Snapchat and Facebook. Snapchat for general chat, Facebook for just memes. We would normally talk all day, especially on Facebook, just send memes back and forth. Recently recently however he is only talking on Facebook in patches. Which is ok but it’s him being online that smells me anxious. He does have depression but I don’t know if it’s related.

For example we were sending memes on Facebook last night, I sent one at 10ish and he still hasn’t viewed it almost a day later. We have however spoken on Snapchat this morning. The issue is he still comes online and it makes me anxious. He comes online as often as every 20 minutes sometimes. Like he just came online now and shared a meme but didn’t view mine, why??

I start wondering who he is talking to if he isn’t talking to me. He doesn’t really have any friends and doesn’t really talk to family much so I start thinking it’s another girl. I don’t get why he just doesn’t answer. I know he could just be checking Facebook but it seems too often. I have even accused friends of talking to him because I sometimes see them coming online at the same time. 

I’m therapy but it’s postponed at the moment due to lockdown. I don’t know what to do, this stresses me out daily. I know I could just not look, or delete the apps but it is harder than it sounds, I always ended up checking.

She sited my deeply engrained negative thoughts of myself, my hyper vigilance and trust issues. All these issues are consequences of years of abuse. I already have diagnosis’s for clinical depression, anxiety and high functioning autism. So my question is what personality disorder could my therapist be suspecting and what I can do to cope.

Disclaimer: LONG READ - feel free to jump to the relevant topics for you. 

I am writing this as my own experience which is rather positive with Zoloft. I am a 32 year old male with major ADHD - the hyperactive type. Severe anxiety - hello mind monkey! - mild depression and IED (Intermittend Explosive disorder). I am writing this as I have been very concerned about taking SSRIs with the  known negative side effects; loss of libido, zombieism and other unpleasant potential side effects. I have been back and forth and researching and reading all the horror stories which by far outweigh the positive posts online. Naturally, as people tend to only voice the bad experiences rather than anything positive. I am purely sharing my own experience here and I understand that whoever is in the position I was in may react the same or different and this is purely a post to help you see the other side of the coin.

Background:
I was undiagnosed until the age of 30. Whilst my life has been rather good in many ways, I felt like it came much more difficult to me than to my peers. Whether it was school, uni, work - whatever it was, I would excel at it, but I had to hustle seemingly more than all the others at the simplest things. Now I understand that mostly I had to hustle with myself, my focus, my irritability, my sadness and my impulsiveness. The person however who struggled the most was my wife. I couldnt drink alcohol as it would turn me into an abusive monster. Any sense of logic would disappear after a mere few drinks and a single tiny argument was enough to put me off the edge. I quit drinking because of that and the symptoms started to get better. However the anxiety, fidgeting, impulsiveness and the intermittent explosions of rage that I had stayed. I didnt know what to do, at that point I knew something was off with me my whole life but I had no clue what it was. I have a great job, we traveled the world and I love my wife dearly. I just couldnt seem to cope with life with the same ease as others around me.

Anger, Depression and Anxiety:
When i turned 32 and after a major explosive rage, I couldn’t bear seeing my wife in tears again so I decided to get treatment. I was prescribed Zoloft and decided to take it despite all the negative side effects. During the first two weeks my anxiety was a roller coaster but the doc said i just needed to wait it out, my depression got better on the 3rd day and my anger has disappeared right away along with my impulsiveness. As if it wasn’t there at all. I was rational. Something that I have not been my entire life as my ADHD was taking over my senses throughout my whole life. I didnt need to buy new things anymore to make myself feel better or chase the serotonin highs 24/7. I felt like a human for the first time in forever. Anxiety - which was debilitating - has disappeared completely after 3 weeks and for the first time in my life I felt at ease.

Now, 3 months into Zoloft - my wife and I have not had fought a single time. NOT ONCE - in 3 months. Locked down in London spending every minute together. In the past - before medication - We would have an argument daily or every second day and a major fight at least once a week. 99% of the time started by me for the most pathetic reasons which were entirely out of my control. Any abusive tendencies that I had in these anger outbreaks have not come up once. Its as If she is married to a different person. Im still struggling with the major ADHD symptoms such as lack of focus and the mind going a million miles and hour but emotionally i am balanced like i never was before. Oh and Btw.. what anxiety?? Something I havent felt in 2 months. 

Sexuality, Zombieism, Loss of Self / Creativity:
I read on many forums that if you are a creative, taking SSRIs will either help your creativity as it will remove the negative mental problems such as depression and anxiety etc, or absolutely ruin it due to killing all emotions inside you. I cant say that my creativity was affected, im fine and happy and I dont feel a loss of self or the scary Zombie state I have read about. As to the sexual experience I have with Zoloft, having ADHD makes you automatically have an increased Libido. Having Sex several times a day, no problem. Hey, everyone knows that’s unrealistic in any relationship thats past the honeymoon phase. The issue with ADHD and Sexuality is that you want it so much that your partner simply will end up disappointing you which will trigger RSD and cause fights. Then you start to secretly masturbate etc etc.. been there, done that. Having started Zoloft, During the first week I jerked off daily to make sure im not losing any libido or erection or establish any other scary side effect. During the second week, I felt my libido was still there but I didn’t think of having sex all the time. What a welcome feeling?! I still masturbated a few times and all worked just as it should. It felt great, i was erect and I had normal orgasms. I noticed it took a little longer but hey, thats welcome. Now, 3 months in, my wife and I have the best sex life we had in years. There is no more pressure on her and that gives her peace and doesnt make her live in fear of not being enough. We schedule it, we can both say no if were not in the mood, its just fun. Just like it should be. 

Sleep:
Thats a point where i struggle. Falling asleep takes longer for me. I take the meds first thing in am but still have trouble falling asleep. I read before sleep but that doesnt help. Also, I wake up every night to go to the bathroom- something I never had before. 

Thats it pretty much. I know its a long read. If I have helped you, I am beyond happy. If you have questions, please ask. I will help where i can. Good luck to us all during this pandemic and stay healthy!",mentalhealth,2021-01-27 12:54:05

Because I have derealization I’m afraid of losing my sense of smell and taste even temporarily (although I know people my age who have lost it for months). It’s scary for me when I constantly struggle with how my reality looks and feels. I already struggle with suicidal thoughts and I’m afraid that the loss of smell and taste along with the brain fog (which is almost more terrifying for me) would push me over the edge. The brain fog terrifies me too because I’ve tried many antidepressants that gave me brain fog even at half the lowest dose and had to stop taking them because they were making my derealization unbearable. But at the same time I’m struggling with the fear of covid. I’m doing what I can but those around me, like my husband and my parents, are being cautious but not to my level. It’s been a strain on me and my husband because he understands it’s difficult for me but he struggles with depression and lost his job back in May and hasn’t been socializing to keep me comfortable. I feel so bad that I make him cancel plans because for my sake. I struggle so much with control and I feel so out of control with this and it brings back some very difficult feelings. I know I need to let go. I know I can’t control everything. I know that I’m making this worse for myself and my husband. But I’m so afraid that covid will be more than I can handle mentally. And I do want to mention I do see a psychiatrist and a therapist (although the therapist sessions have been spotty lately because of her schedule). I appreciate responses but especially from those who are more familiar with DPDR and BPD. Thankyou.",mentalhealth,2021-01-27 13:21:08

Back in September 2018 I broke from working a job that really wasn't good for me, after an episode at my job i for the first time in my life had an actual panic attack, this lead to an extended sick leave, which ended in a mutual termination from my job position. Spent almost a year unemployed untill November I got my current job of doing odd jobs at construction sites.

The day after the episode at my old job, I called my doctor, and my doctor told me, after dialogue, that it might not even be months but weeks untill I would be in the hospital from stress. I did the sick leave, no treatment but doctor consultations.
Now ever since then I've had periods of feeling really down, could be a couple days, sometimes a week or two. But for the past 7-8 months, that down period has stayed, with only a few days I feel less shitty, not good, just less shitty.
During this all this time, I feel absolutely worthless, I wake up every day not wanting to get out of bed, I basicly sleep, go to work, go home, then just exist in a state of self-loathing, guilt and shame, then sleep and repeat. Here it's important for me to add I really like the job i work and the company I work at. During the time I have been having suicide thoughts, thinking not only my friends, but everything would be better off without me. I don't believe I could follow through with it.

I have a lot of really good and supportive friends, one of which is currently being treated for depression. They have all expressed they are really worried about me, and really want me to seek help.
Where I am right now, I just really want this feeling to end, I know rationally suicide does more harm than help, so I really want to call my doctor and figure out if there's any way I can get help.
I can't bear that the people closest to me worries about me.
Now here's the problem I am facing.
Everything about this call, and the possible process afterwards absolutely frightens me. From feeling like I've failed, since I can't handle this on my own, to the possible therapy where a stranger tells me what's fucked with me.
But the biggest hurdle I am facing. Is just fucking picking up the fucking phone and calling my doctor.
What the hell do u even say? Will they even take me seriously? What if i don't actually need help, and just need to quit being a little bitch?
I have already spend over a week just building up the guts to call them, still haven't succeeded. I keep remembering when I called them last time, how anxious I felt. I was literally shaking in my hands and legs.

All in all I know what I have to do, but I just don't feel like I can, I don't feel like I have the courage or strength to do it, no matter how much I want to.",mentalhealth,2021-01-27 13:28:42

I know something isn't right with me, whether it's a mental health issue or not, something isn't right. And for a long time I've had a feeling it might be OCD, however I do not was to self diagnose.

I have a serious issue with 'checking'. Door handles, taps, plugs, switches, windows, electrical appliances, candles etc.  I am terrified of something bad happening like a break in, or a house fire. So for whatever reason every morning and every night I have the urges to check all of these things multiple times to be sure that a fire/break in wont happen. Plugs and wires cannot touch because I worry it would cause a fire. It makes me late for everything when I need to leave the house, and causes me to have restless nights too. I also have intrusive thoughts which I am very ashamed of, about murder, incest, rape and other horrible things.

Basically I want to go and talk to a doctor about what is going on, but I am just crippled with fear that will tell me I'm fine and or just think I'm overreacting. Or they might think that I have gone in and described symptoms that are so close to OCD that I probably went in there with the intention of getting that diagnosis, and that I'm lying.

I also don't think I would be comfortable talking about my intrusive thoughts as I am so embarrassed by them. I worry that if I don't talk about them, then again they'll think I'm lying or that it's not serious? I don't even necessarily want a diagnosis, I just want some help.

I guess I am just looking for some reassurance, did anyone else have similar worries when considering going to your doctor? If you did, what was the outcome?",mentalhealth,2021-01-27 13:35:18

Basically I'm really bad at socialising with people, be it small talk, even just greeting someone makes me anxious in advance. This has been a huge struggle for me ever since I was little. I'd like to think of this as a first step at getting better while doing what I enjoy spending time on.

I've seen several people mention this, how streaming content with commentary/on twitch improved their communication skills drastically over time. This seems like decent idea to me, having to stick to a schedule would break my routine hopefully. And ever since I started working on it I feel super productive which I haven't felt in a looong while. But mostly, meet new people (I can't for now see, face to face :3) and interact with them.

What I planned so far was streaming art and while I'm not the best at it, I really enjoy drawing and it relaxes me. 

I told my friends about this and they're thinking opposite. They explained that they're worried I won't get views and will end up disappointed. Which I fully understand, there's so many people streaming already, more talented(and definitely better at talking lol), and while I'm expecting such outcome , I still feel like giving it a go.  It's crazy idea, but I don't know.  Is it really? I want to get out of my comfort zone and do something completely random at least once in my life.",mentalhealth,2021-01-27 13:37:18

My most recent nightmare was my best friend who I have known for 11 years committed suicide.

We are both teenagers but her mental health is worse than mine. She is amused by death and a lot of things related. To sum it up her mind prefers hell over heaven though it's an example she's not religious. She has had suicidal thoughts before and after I woke up from this dream I was hyperventilating and crying. I can't imagine losing her. She's been a great support to me as I have been to her but as I said she has it worse than me. Even thinking of losing her makes me cry. I told her about it to have relief just in case she was not feeling good or there was something she hasn't told me but she did not take it seriously. She thought it was cool that I was able to see her splattered body in my dream but what struck her was when I told her what she said before she jumped in my dream is something we would actually say in real life. She copes with her problems by making jokes about them. I don't know if I wanted to hear something different from her which is why I told her but it is just stuck in my head and I can't get it out.

Called the reception and they said there was no appointment, that my next one was in March (which I was never told about). The receptionist arranged a phone call with the on call doctor, who said he would speak to my case manager and see what he can do. 

I received a phone call from him again about an hour ago. He told me because I'm not on daily medication, they won't give me something I can take for as and when when I feel anxious.

I am an 18 yrs old guy , entp 6w7.
 For the past half a year maybe I've been sort of building upon these thoughts of the world is sort of fake , not necessarily a simulation , that it's just all a halluciantion and that I cant really see how other people see the world , in a sense simulating their reality .
 I even lost a lot of anxiety from sitting with people I dont know . I just enter this state of mind where the cloud if thoughts comes back and sort of ""tells"" me that I cant feel connected truly because you can never truly know in what kind of reality the other people are living . 
I feel like I am in a bubble and everytime I can connect with someone and feel that connection eases me and makes me forget about that cloud's existence . There's a lot to be said here but I don't know if it's worth it since it's hard to project these feelings .
Everytime I am interacting with a human I feel this lack of a bridge between us in the sense that they have their own bubble I have mine . You know how you sometimes stare into space thinking something high up in your head . I get that but at a lower level where I can still talk and all but I keep thinking the collection of thoughts about the world that I've collected (related to what I've described until now) and I am only half focusing on what I could say to the person and do with them .
Since I am quite aware of the passage of time too I look back and I also feel like I've lost myself somewhere . I feel like I am living a different version of reality in some sense . After so much of what I think , act and talk has changed I feel like it's a way too different me since I can't connect with ""simpler"" people I used to have fun with .
At this point I am desperate because I know I am not getting better with it , it keeps piling up . If you can help please do so . I don't need any ""it's gonna be fine don't worry"" I know it's bad and I am not headed where I should be.",mentalhealth,2021-01-27 13:58:53

He also struggled really bad with depression and witnessing that as a kid has left me terrified to fall into that same behaviour loop. I find myself in this weird place where I’m borderline functioning but also feel like I could function better on medication. 

I’ve spent my whole life running from being “like my dad” so I moved to a city, I got the career I wanted as a kid and managed to do pretty alright for myself. I did some therapy, and I found it helped in the moment, but sometimes I have these days where I could use therapy but it’s not like I can just call up and ask for help on the fly. My mental illness (whatever it is as I’m undiagnosed) has never gotten in the way, but it’s exhausting to put on my happy go lucky face on days that I’m not really feeling that. Especially the ones where I feel I can’t get out of bed. I definitely try to call in sick when I’m really feeling out of it but it’s gotten to be a little too often, and even when I do the entire “sick day” is spent reeling in guilt. 

My symptoms on bad days are severe fatigue, being grumpy, sensitivity to light (preferring dark spaces) and really really heavy feelings of guilt for not being able to do anything. I’m aware it’s happening because my apartment will get messy, my laundry piles up and I spend a string of days without leaving the house. But then on the other hand my good days I’m great, pretty normal human guy. My boyfriend tells me I’m one of the most social people he’s met and that I have a talent for charming people in those kinds of situations. To be super clear those bad days are usually only a string of 4-5 days that come up once a month or so unless something else is going on in my life that’s got me down and out. 

Here’s my issue. I’m now dating this person and I know if it continues to go well we’ll eventually live together. Right now, we see each other for a while and then when he leaves after a few days I’m exhausted. I lay in bed, play video games and find myself needing at least 3-4 days of down time after socializing with him. This was true when I was working as well. I’d work all week, only to need to stay inside with the curtains drawn on my day or two off.

Is it worth seeking out medication when I’m not experiencing symptoms that are extreme? I’m worried that if I try medication it will alter my brain chemistry and push me into a more dangerous head space where I may fall into a complete depression. My whole life I feel like I’ve been playing this balancing act, but it’s still restrictive because I’m missing out on things I wanna do like having a regular workout routine, doing more things on my own &amp; having regular down time hobbies that isn’t just gaming. 

I feel so much guilt and I just want to either be comfortable having days where I lay in bed until the late evening, or I wanna find a way to get up and move on those days in a way that doesn’t make me feel like I’m carrying the entire weight of the world on my back.",mentalhealth,2021-01-27 14:08:04

The problem is that while I can recognize on the surface that my socially anxious and depressive thoughts are just my mental illness speaking, I can't really accept that they aren't true. I can tell myself that thinking nothing will get better and that there is no point in anything is illogical and keeping me down, that not everything points to doom and gloom and that there are cases in life where that isn't backed by evidence. That doesn't mean that I don't still believe it on some level, regardless of inconsistencies. The mental illness doesn't really care about logical evidence.

Some days I feel very productive and like I can accomplish anything and others I find it hard to focus on any task. Sometimes I'm very happy and others I'm very sad or very mad for no reason and yell at others in my family for no reason. Sometimes I feel very empty other times I'm so hyper and can talk a million miles a minute and can't control it. Some days I feel extremely overconfident and others feel worthless and a failure. I cant focus some days and ill do anything but what I should be doing. I constantly have a racing mind with obsessive thoughts that I can get away from, I'm constantly paranoid about something. Sometimes I'm in the heat of the moment and do things I usually wouldn't and end up regretting it (unprotect sex). I often feel like I am losing control of having fluctuating perspectives of those around me and feel like they are trying to hurt me. These symptoms get in the way of my daily tasks and cause me a lot of distress and consequences. Every bipolar test I've taken online indicates i have symptoms of BPD but I understand that this is not a real diagnosis, therefore I have an appointment with a psychiatrist.

I am currently struggling quite a bit with remembering the things I have done in the past, that I regret so deeply, and have been giving my quite intense anxiety and guilt the past week or so.

An occurrence happened a week or so ago, that invited me to delve into my past life, and actions that I had done in my past that were 'not' me and out of character, and were at the time 'justified' by the crowd I hung around, and my naivety to what was morally wrong.

I myself, am quite the anxious, OCD/Overthinker, and I have been running through various scenarios in my head that have been scaring me, and I know at the time that I am just overthinking, It's hard to tell myself to stop these worries. Although the things I regret happened years ago, this sudden remembering of these things has shocked me, and I keep telling/convincing myself that these issues will re-surface, and people would call me out, although, I know this is quite far fetched, I just can't get these thoughts out of my head.

I looked into OCD confessions etc. Which Is something I have never heard of before, and I don't really want to go down a rabbit hole of self diagnosing etc, what I want, is some guidance in understanding that out-of-character things that I have done, are in the past, and that I can't change the past. Whilst I have learnt an insane amount from these actions, I still want some reconciliation and re-assurance in understanding my feelings and making this constant regret go away. It's getting hard for me to think about these things that I've done years ago that I had practically forgotten about. 

&amp;#x200B;

Any relation/guidance would be very greatly appreciated.",mentalhealth,2021-01-27 14:57:36

I'm experiencing a lot of undiagnosed problems and I can't seem to get myself to talk about it with anyone. I can tell my family, but it's very embarassing and it's like I feel internal pressure to solve it myself. I'll shorten this as much as possible: 

• OCD symptoms, obsessions and compulsions. My parents know about this and I got treatment for this. Treatment did help a bit. By the way, I'm not actually diagnosed with OCD or anything, really.

• Daydreaming obsessively. This is the actually embarassing problem because I daydream a LOT over characters I made. I've daydreamed since I was younger, but it got extreme when I got older. Not sure if my worsening mental health intensified it. I read that this is called maladaptive daydreaming and I'm trying to overcome it without help, but it's hard.

• I have a voice that constantly bullies me. It calls me all sorts of names. It makes me not want to talk about any of these issues because I'll sound ""too whiny"". It also pressures me to commit suicide. I know this voice isn't real, I hear it in my head. But it also makes me feel guilty for having all of my problems because I can't think of any traumas that potentially triggered it. I had a somewhat normal childhood and I didn't have to deal with abuse.

Do I continue to try and overcome this on my own? I know that making lifestyle changes and using therapy books can be really helpful and I'm thinking of trying that instead.",mentalhealth,2021-01-27 15:20:11

I'm not that good in putting my thoughts and emotions on paper and especially saying them so I'm sorry if stuff isn't that well structured.

I don't usually fall in love and it's rare, but when I do, it's all in and I give everything I have, as corny as that sounds its true. Haven't been in a relationship since 2016. The brake up wasnt bad, we still talked, it was her choise. When that happened I partially blamed on myself, I said I wasn't good enough, I needed to be better. So that's what I tried to do, improve myself. That was one of the many points that pushed me along in my life.

Fast forward to now, I'm 2 year away from becoming a bachelor in Software Engineering, have a stable job as a programmer and relatevly decent income for my age. I thought I was at the peak. I had pretty much all I wanted, stable life, good friends, a nice car and yet I feel like I've achieved nothing. I have all this and no one next to me that I can share with. Is something wrong with me? Am I doing something wrong? Do I need to do more? Fuck, I guess so. Grind must go on. And here I am sitting in my couch all alone either working or being miserable or drinking and smoking to numm this idiotic feeling.

I feel useless. To everyone else. To the one person that I have feelings for and yet all I do is in vein.

The shittiest part of all is, I don't even have problem with rejection from the other person, she won't be the first nor the last I imagine, but the blankness I get from the other side is numming. It could be that I'm reading it wrong and she is trying to do it politely, but why does she keep messaging me and why do the convoys continue for hours. Its not what I have experienced before.

I guess she is judging my capabilities. Well I've done quite a lot now, it's probably not enough. I need to push more

Some days I feel very productive and like I can accomplish anything and others I find it hard to focus on any task. Sometimes I'm very happy and others I'm very sad or very mad for no reason and yell at others in my family for no reason. Sometimes I feel very empty other times I'm so hyper and can talk a million miles a minute and can't control it. Some days I feel extremely overconfident and others feel worthless and a failure. I cant focus some days and ill do anything but what I should be doing. I constantly have a racing mind with obsessive thoughts that I can get away from, I'm constantly paranoid about something. Sometimes I'm in the heat of the moment and do things I usually wouldn't and end up regretting it (unprotect sex). I often feel like I am losing control of having fluctuating perspectives of those around me and feel like they are trying to hurt me. These symptoms get in the way of my daily tasks and cause me a lot of distress and consequences. Every bipolar test I've taken online indicates i have symptoms of BPD but I understand that this is not a real diagnosis, therefore I have an appointment with a psychiatrist. I just want someone's opinion on this to see if having BPD is a possibility.",mentalhealth,2021-01-27 16:19:35
