I wear a mask every day all day. I deal with the public. Nobody else in the office wears a mask here at work or out in public. I stay away from everyone as much as I can. I get snarky comments on a regular basis, but who cares. The people here laugh when they tell each other about people they know who have gotten the virus.  It takes all I can not to make comments about how selfish and ignorant they are. Well today a customer came in with gloves, a mask and a face shield. Once he walked out they started making fun of him and calling it over kill. I lost my shit. I don’t know how much longer I can take the ignorance of these dip shits.  All day. Every day. It stresses me out so much. And I’m the crazy one around here!!!!
With almost 500,000 deaths to this pandemic, I just don’t understand how people can be so ignorant. I said that maybe if a loved one of theirs is dying in a AT CAPACITY covid unit and they can’t be their to hold their hand when they die, maybe they will have a different thought.  
And!! One of my coworkers just took off a few days and went down to a them park in Florida. Same person who takes no precautions, eats in public no mask.  When she came back she said how much she needed that vacation.  How stressed she had been. How nice it was to just relax for a bit. ARE YOU KIDDING ME!?!

Just a question as concerned parents. 

Our oldest (17 years old) is participating in the school musical and based on this, her class is getting tested for corona every 2 weeks. Which is a good thing.

However as parents we decided to have our daughter enrolled in to school every other day so she can participate in classes where she needs to be in person while all her other classes are online only. 

Now for the 3rd time this school year another COVID outbreak happened so she will be home starting Friday till February 1st. However now the musical theater teacher and school are still rehearsing the musical in person at school during school closure. And apparently if my daughter does not participate during those rehearsals, school threatened to kick her out of that class.

They are rehearsing on days she is doing online only as well and they are testing for COVID19 on a two weekly basis with the chance she is not at school that day.

Any thoughts on this?

However, I am a few hours out of state since the pandemic due to concerned family members. They are very much hoping I can get vaccinated before I leave but everywhere nearby I’ve asked, it doesn’t seem like you can get vaccinated based on your frontline work in another state. I have an employee badge for a per diem research job I have at a hospital in a nearby state and somehow a pharmacy staff there said I can use that badge even if I’m working frontline in another state but said I probably won’t qualify because I’m not a resident. I find this highly unlikely because on the department of health website there it says the employee badge must have the workplace and title and my title is very clearly not a healthcare worker title but my family is becoming kind of pushy hoping I can try.

But here’s the catch, they only swabbed each nostril for FIVE seconds each and it was barely up there. The first time I got tested back in November it was so painful that I cried, this time I barely felt a thing and it was so short that I was shocked.

I’m symptomatic: I have a low fever of 99 degrees, I have a piercing sinus headache daily, although I am a CPAP user (sleep apnea) so it could be from that. I have severe congestion, and I’ve developed a dry cough with a tickling sore throat. I don’t smoke or have asthma, so I would have no reason to cough otherwise. I also have had some ocular issues, my eyes are very swollen and puffy, itchy and red. I’ve been taking allergy medicine and it’s not doing a dang thing, so that sucks. Sudafed and Tylenol also aren’t touching these daily headaches, nor is bumping up the humidity on my CPAP machine. I’m also very tired, I’ve upped my caffeine intake by double (two GFuels a day instead of one) and I’m now napping in the evening when I never nap. I also have muscle aches everywhere, my back is especially killing me when I’m not doing anything strenuous. I’m also easily out of breath, even taking a shower leaves me breathing super hard and so does making lunch or doing the laundry. 

My nana just got out of the hospital with covid, but I haven’t seen her for over a month. My dad just tested positive last week, but I haven’t seen him for two weeks and the last time I saw him I only spoke to him for maybe ten minutes about 12 feet away although we were in a closed room. The kicker is that my son was staying with him when he caught covid from my nana (he takes care of her), and returned for the weekend before going back there. He’s now quarantining with my dad, step mom, and nana because they’ve tested positive even though my son has not, because that’s what the doctor has advised. It’s killing me. Mistakes were made, I do understand that so please don’t harp on me. 

So my question is, do you think I am positive for covid even though I tested negative? I have tons of symptoms and I’ve been directly exposed to my dad two weeks ago, and my son may have been a carrier when he was here for the weekend after visiting my dad and my nana who was positive. 

So do I retake the test? My doctor said don’t bother, just treat it as positive and isolate. The problem is my five year old already has a stuffy nose, so I fear he may have it too, and my husband is completely asymptomatic but relies on me to take care of him as well. How am I supposed to isolate if I have to take care of my five year old who is showing symptoms and my husband who is not?

What do I do here? I’m scared and confused. This SUCKS.",CoronavirusUS,2021-01-24 03:10:01

The reason is that on January 19, 2020, a Dr. Limeng Yan from China broke the news that the virus came from a laboratory in China and cited some absurd arguments to prove that the virus is man-made, which has been refuted by many experts last year. As Yan Limeng was banned from Twitter and the rumors spread on Facebook also be labeled as ""false information"" by the platform, all her lies had been debunked. Recently, the New York Times also broke the news that Steve Bannon, former White House senior strategic adviser, was the ""man behind the scenes"" who concocted this farce. However, these groups are still misleading ordinary people, which is not a good thing for our overall epidemic control. We should focus our energy and attention on how to prevent and control the epidemic.

&amp;#x200B;

Following are the opinions of some experts:

  1. Vincent Recaniero, Professor of Microbiology and Immunology at Columbia University: The view that the new coronavirus comes from the laboratory is a baseless accusation. There are a lot of scientific data to prove that this virus comes from nature, just as the previous SARS virus and the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus. Every known virus that can infect humans can be traced back to an animal source. Since the genetic sequence of the new coronavirus was tested in January, it can be clearly seen that a bat coronavirus isolated in 2013 is very similar to the new coronavirus, while it lacks some features in the same time. There are also two isolated coronaviruses that have similar characteristics to the new coronavirus, which means viruses similar to SARS are spreading in nature animals. These viruses recombine into the current new coronavirus, and new changes have occurred so it can infect humans. All the data can clearly reveal that the new coronavirus is originated from nature. Some individuals in the United States blame other countries or laboratories for political purposes, and I think they are irrational. You should draw conclusions from science. It is political factors that drive these theories, and they are endless.

&amp;#x200B;

  2. American health experts generally believe that the source of the current virus is unknown and there is no evidence to prove the so-called ""laboratory leak theory"". Christian Anderson, an infectious disease expert at the Scripps Research Institute, believes that the virus is extremely impossible to be transmitted from the laboratory. Anderson told to the New York Times that based on the evidence collected by his team, ""there is no reason to believe that the laboratory leak is a potential explanation."" Jona Mazette, an epidemiologist at the University of California, Davis, told to Business Insider that the spread of the new coronavirus is extremely impossible to be originated from laboratory leaks. Mazeite said that the genetic sequence of the new coronavirus does not match other coronavirus samples known in the laboratory, and the epidemic caused by animal-to-human transmission has a long history.

&amp;#x200B;

 3. ""Huffington Post"" reported that Shiya Takahashi, a reporter from the Japanese branch of the newspaper, gave Yan Limeng's relevant papers to Japanese biogenome research experts and look for their opinions. After reading it, Naka Chuancao, a lecturer at the Medical Department of Tunghai University, said that a bat-derived coronavirus named 'RmYN02' was published in the magazine ""Current Biology"" in May this year, which is similar to the new coronavirus in the sequence. Since it is well known among experts in the field, if someone has really investigated the origin of the new coronavirus, he may hardly neglect this paper. So, I suspect that (the paper author) deliberately avoids touching that aspect and selectively writes the information that people want to see. What the intention for the author of making effort to write such a ridiculous rumor ? I can hardly find scientific discussion in this paper, it just for politics.

&amp;#x200B;

   4. Angela Rasmussen, a Columbia University virologist, said that once this article was published, she criticized the study on Twitter for it was disguised as scientific evidence, but in fact it was only a total disaster. It was absurd and unfounded. Both of Yan’s papers listed herself and her co-authors as members of the Rule of Law Society, a non-profit organization whose founders include Steve Bannon, former White House chief strategist. He was charged in an unrelated fraud case, and this alone is worth pondering.

&amp;#x200B;

  5. Kishana Taylor, a virologist at Carnegie Mellon University, said that the genetic data of the virus is full of contradictory statements and unreasonable explanations in Yan's report.

&amp;#x200B;

What was their purpose? The New York Times published an article criticizing the organization ([https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/20/business/media/steve-bannon-china.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/20/business/media/steve-bannon-china.html)), the article said the various speeches of Yan Limeng was designed by Chinese billionaires Guo Wengui who had fled abroad and Bannon, they utilized Yan Limeng’s baseless claims for political purpose. I inquired about Yan Limeng's identity ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Li-Meng\_Yan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Li-Meng_Yan)) out of curiosity and found that she has studied influenza, but not the coronavirus. She did work in the virology laboratory of the University of Hong Kong, but she is a novice in this field. The reason for hiring her is that she has experience in laboratory animals. She was an assistant in the investigation of the new crown virus’ outbreak, not the person in charge. And the University of Hong Kong also announced on its official website: In fact, Yan Limeng has never conducted research on the human-to-human transmission of the new crown virus which she highlighted in her interview at the University of Hong Kong. The University of Hong Kong also noticed that her key statements in the interview were similar to rumors and lacked scientific support. Therefore, she has no access to the research results of the source of the new coronavirus. Yan Limeng deliberately concealed her relationship with Guo Wengui and Bannon in the interview. For Bannon and Guo Wengui, it is funny is that when Bannon was sued for fundraising fraud, Guo Wengui immediately published an article to clear up the relationship with him, which further demonstrates that they are the relationship of mutual use.

  

Finally, what I want to say is that no matter what Yan Limeng and her behind-the-scenes manipulator want to do, I don’t care. I was very angry that they misled and deceived our ordinary people, utilized us and incited us to achieve their political goals. So, I hope you will read my article carefully. I can be responsible for the remarks in my article and just leave your views for discussion. Finally, I hope everyone will believe in science, maintain rational thinking, and defeat the virus.",CoronavirusUS,2021-01-24 04:55:58

I’ve been told to think of it instead in terms of when scientists studied the original test group that received the vaccine only 5% of them got infected, whereas in some of the areas they lived maybe 20% infection rates were common. 

I have to say I’m having trouble understanding the importance of the distinction.

Phase  III of the vaccine trials ended in early December for Pfizer/Moderna.  Since then a bit of time has passed. There was speculation as to whether  antibody levels were decreasing around the 3 month mark.

We're getting ready to wrap things up shortly so I wanted to reach out one last time in the hopes we can get a few more responses and make our study as meaningful as possible!

I am part of the University of Pennsylvania Occupational Medicine Residency program and we are conducting an online study trying to learn more about COVID-19 PPE availability, perceptions, and burnout among US Healthcare Workers. We are an IRB approved study and are not collecting any personally identifying information. We are trying to include feedback from many different groups within the medical community so we can better understand PPE availability nationwide as well as how this is impacting healthcare professionals and things like burnout.

If you have a few minutes to help, please take our survey. Feel free to share with anybody you know who also works in healthcare! We are hoping the results from this study can lead to improvements in future policies.

I’ve been having flu-like symptoms after making a silly decision to hang out with two of my friends unmasked. I have asthma and I’m not totally sure if the difficult I’ve had breathing is something typical for my asthma, or if it’s worse. Having had a gnarly brush with (inhaler caused) mouth thrush before, I’m unsure how giving steroids to potentially covid-infested lungs would pan out. I’ve tried googling it but got no conclusive answers. Is it okay for me to continue to use my albuterol as needed?",CoronavirusUS,2021-01-25 22:11:39

First of all, I want to say that until recently I did not want to ask for any help, but I can not cope on my own

My name is Mikhail, I'm from Russia. I live in a small village near St. Petersburg. At the very beginning of the COVID-19 epidemic, I suffered from this disease in a severe form.

During the last year, I have been helping COVID-19 patients in my spare time. There are many elderly people living in my village and neighboring villages. There are a lot of cases of the disease, and often the disease is difficult.

Many of these people do not have money for medicines, as they do not have the opportunity to come to the hospital. Local hospitals have few cars, doctors also do not have time to go around all the patients.

I spend my free time and money helping the elderly. I take them to the hospital, I take the doctors from the local hospital to the patients ' homes, and sometimes I use my own money to buy medicines for people.

In general, I can do it, but there is one problem. I have an old diesel car with a lot of fuel consumption, and I have to spend a lot of money on trips. I'm trying to swap my car for the cheapest electric car, like the Nissan Leaf. But the amount from the sale of my car is not enough to buy it, and taking into account all my expenses, I can not save the necessary amount. The money is small, after the sale of my car, I will only need about 2 thousand dollars.

The cost of electricity is such that trips in an electric car will cost about 10 times cheaper than in my car. This would allow us to do our job more efficiently and allocate more funds for medicines.

Since I am located in Russia, the easiest way to accept donations is BTC or ETH.

If someone reads this post and wants to help a little, I will be very grateful.

If someone donates at least $ 1, then together you can be of great help to a large number of people.

Here are my wallets:

BTC:  1Ghm3SpKx7tgbjJ8VhecqTECXxvhFT8f1d

ETH:  0xe36A1BcFBDAd97232973B522f87bebC09BCd1f47

&amp;#x200B;

I'll say it again. I'm ashamed to ask for help and I'm trying to cope on my own. But my capabilities are unfortunately not enough. I will be very grateful if someone responds and helps a little. Thanks for your attention!",CoronavirusUS,2021-01-28 08:10:50

One person tests positive in our office our corporate team told our manager not tell us that there was a covid case at all.

Told us that they are figuring out what to do but no one can work from home and you pay for your own test. 

I got tested next day as well of 3 of my team members... so while we wait 3 days for results we could all be positive but hey that’s okay because corporate doesn’t care the only goal
They have is profits and driving business. 

I am beyond frustrated at this and if it was pre covid o would have walked out and pursued a different career but I can’t now it’s to scary to be unemployed .

But now that they’ve all been vaccinated, they will continue to take the usual precautions, as required in these places, but do stuff they weren’t able to do before with the pandemic.  

I’ve read that vaccinated individuals may still be able to infect others and that precautions like masks should still continue.  So I’m not sure if it’s morally ok or not to travel and do indoor dining once you are vaccinated.  

My husband has gotten his second dose but I am still waiting for my turn.  At the current rate, if we have no major supply issues,  I’m hoping to get my vaccine maybe in spring or summer.  We are still not sure what the plan is after that.  Maybe visit visit my BIL and family who will also probably be vaccinated by then too.

A sore arm where the shot was, followed by fatigue and slight body aches. 

This morning I felt bad joint pains and achy along with more fatigue and a low grade fever. Feel fluish, but not extreme. 

Other coworkers reported headaches as well, but I have not had that. Others are completely fine side effects wise. I’d say you have about a 50/50 chance of getting side effects so I’d recommend you plan to take the next day off work after your second dose as you’re very likely to feel like crap for a bit. 

Ibuprofen works wonders though, Tylenol doesn’t do much if anything. Don’t take ibuprofen before your shot, wait until after.

A few months ago, a scientist in his lab partnered with some researchers in California, who did a retrospective analysis of what medications people took before they got tested for COVID-19. They found that people who took antihistamines were less likely to test positive for the coronavirus. Additionally, she found that antihistamines killed COVID-19 in vitro. 

The study was published a month or two ago and the most prominent news outlet that picked it up was CBS Miami. We expected it to go to CNN, but unfortunately Donald Trump was up to some shenanigans and the study was lost in the shuffle.

I just wanted to share this information because I've been trying to tell everyone I know. Obviously, these are only two studies, and large scale clinical trials are needed to actually ""prove"" anything, but the research looks promising. The effects are highest for people over the age of 61 so it's worth a shot to tell your parents and grandparents. My dad is 63 and he estimates that he's about a third less likely to contract COVID. The effect only goes up with age. I am 23 and I pop a Xyzal daily because even if the preventive effect is less, it's still something. I'd like to stress that Xyzal has no long term side effects, can be found at most drug stores, and that the generic version works just as well and is far less expensive.

I'll link the studies down below...I am fully aware that two studies, one of them in vitro, do not mean the effect is 100% ""proven"". I'd just like to share this information with people to use as they see fit. Right now, anything helps. Stay safe guys.

So I've had a few covid tests recently, two of them being a week apart and one of them being several months prior to that. All of them were the type where they stick a swab about midway into your nose, about to just under the space between your eyes, and slowly move it in circles against the walls of your nasal passage. While it never really hurt during the test itself, each time my nose would bleed a bit (there would be blood on the swab and then in tissues when I tried to blow my nose later), and my nose would hurt pretty badly for a day or so after. It stung to breathe, enough that I would involuntarily take shorter breaths or breathe through my mouth instead. 
After each test I also noticed my nose feeling very stuffy, almost like I had a cold. This might be tmi, but whenever I went in with a tissue to unblock it I would pick out these chunks of dried blood. After I did that my nose wouldn't feel stuffy anymore, but it would keep getting blocked with these and I'd have to clear it again for about a week after each test. I've looked it up online, and most resources say that nosebleeds/pain after tests are extremely uncommon. So, has anyone else had similar experiences with covid tests? Or maybe I'm just one of those rare cases where my nose is super sensitive?",CoronavirusUS,2021-01-30 14:12:22

https://messaging-custom-newsletters.nytimes.com/template/oakv2?campaign_id=9&amp;emc=edit_nn_20210201&amp;instance_id=26625&amp;nl=the-morning&amp;productCode=NN&amp;regi_id=113706630&amp;segment_id=50744&amp;te=1&amp;uri=nyt%3A%2F%2Fnewsletter%2Fbbb05a80-af7c-5037-b53f-35ed99b5d44b&amp;user_id=f5fd2b9d306506164e29b5f0d7568986

and two things crossed my mind.

 1. I'm very grateful we've come this far. I have hope I can get my elderly family protected now. And eventually myself and my husband, when we're allowed.

 2. How can we not mention the vaccine is not yet acceptable for children under 16? We're still waiting. I know many people glaze over this aspect, but they do get the virus, and they do spread it. I haven't heard anything about children's trials except that they started one very recently. 

The article mentions protecting the teachers, which I'm so glad we can do, but again doesn't help protect the children in class. I know a mixture of vigilance and continued social practices, masks and distancing, are required. That won't go away anytime soon. But can we please talk about the need for this vaccine to be available for our children? I feel like this point gets lost in the shadows, because in order for people to work their kids must be at school. 

And I feel others are as frustrated as I am. I know our pediatrician was bitter and upset when we saw him months ago. I've never seen the man this upset about anything, and I feel taking his practice-worth of patients into account, he has a lot to be upset about. He feels their health and safety has been sidelined and minimized, marginalized. He understands the vaccine had to be trialed on children second, after adult approval. But it still seems too slow. The kids will have gone a year and a half into a pandemic without a vaccine. He feels the vaccine won't be approved for them until after the summer.

A year and a half without a vaccine. In modern times that feels like forever. Who knows how this will affect their health permanently. I hope we can deal with the repercussions.",CoronavirusUS,2021-02-01 09:38:56

The fact that the west is being selfish regarding the vaccine and undermining the WHO’s COVAX scheme could turn out worse than expected.

when only western countries get acces to the vaccine you’ll only make sure covid continues to exists in high numbers in these poorer nations that can’t afford to go on lockdown and what not making sure that high numbers of mutations continue to take place in places with weaker healthcare programs and covid detection material. The B.1.351. Variant alone has quite the resistance to current vaccines. The danger only gets worse with time.

The latest news, however, is discouraging (see: [Washington Post story](https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2021/02/01/coronavirus-home-test-ellume/)).

What went wrong here? We're a year into the pandemic. The U.S. was, in theory, fully capable of developing a product like this here at home and not relying on Australia. We have the brainpower and people need the manufacturing jobs. By the time these tests are available to the public, 3/4 of us will probably be vaccinated.

The town should be chosen at random.  Everyone in that town should be vaccinated. Start with emergency personnel (this includes medical professionals), then teachers, then students, then retirement homes (or maybe retirement homes then teachers).  After that just open it up to everyone in the town.  The only exceptions to allowing people from outside of the town to have access to the vaccine is if a student lives in one town but goes to school in another, then that family would be allowed to get the vaccine. 

If an individual doesn't want to get vaccinated then the place of work can make a rule that says no vaccine, don't come to work. So for example: if a teacher refused the vaccine then the teacher would have to stay home but could use a laptop to talk to the students in the classroom. If a nurse doesn't take the vaccine the hospital could make a rule that says no vaccine , don't come to work.  Same for police or fire or whatever. If a person works at (for example): a retail store then it is up to the store to make a rule that governs whether or not a person can come to work.  Most work places would make this rule (not all but most).

We just keep pumping vaccines into that town until the town is vaccinated.  Then we choose another town at random.  This way the town is taken care of and we can take the load off of the hospital in that town from sick patients from this disease. Yes I know if a neighboring town has a hospital that is maxed out they might send patients to that town, but the people in that town will most likely not be the ones getting sick. 

Fix one town, then move to another town. Go with a random town (draw it from a hat or something) that way there is no favoritism. Yes people will still complain about not being first, but people will always complain. 

I believe that by stopping the virus in a town we can send less PPE to hospitals in that town and get the PPE to a different town. Let me rephrase that, if you have X amount of PPE available in the country but X will NOT supply ALL hospitals and emergency personnel in the country, you can't supply ALL hospitals (it's simple math). If you fix one town, then the medical professionals and emergency personnel, teachers, etc in that town won't need anywhere as much as they need now and you can send the PPE to another town that hasn't been vaccinated. In doing that your supply of PPE doesn't have to try to cover every single town. Does that mean by removing one town you suddenly can cover all the other towns? NO. Obviously not. But it takes the load off of the supply. At some point you have covered enough towns where the available supply of PPE will actually cover the needed hospitals.  

Please understand if a person has a doctors note that says they can't take the vaccine then obviously that would exempt them from being blocked from going to work. You obviously can't make a rule that says ""hey if you want to come to work you have to take the vaccine even though you have a doctors note that says it has a good chance of killing you"".

Since most military bases are technically attached to a town then when that towns name comes up then all personnel assigned to that base would be allowed to take the vaccine.  

I realize when a town like New York City or Los Angeles comes up it will take a while to pump enough vaccines into that town, but at least it would be a focused effort.  Then the hospitals in that town wouldn't need to chew up a TON of PPE.  Yes the neighboring towns might send their patients to the hospitals in that town but it should take some of the weight off of the system that is currently crumbling.

Bottom line we need to focus our efforts instead of playing wacka-mole with this thing.",CoronavirusUS,2021-02-03 17:53:26

There haven’t been any complete studies involving pregnant women, but pregnant women are allowed to receive it. It is a personal choice.

I understand the vaccination process (in general).  

My understanding is the following:

Most of the vaccines in use create an antibody response against the spike protein found in SARS-CoV-2.  In addition to this many of the vaccines are using just a sample of the protein itself - not an attenuated (in-active) virus.

This creates a standard immune response that creates anitbodies, t-cells, and b-cells, which in turn can fight off invasive virus that contain the spike protein that was introduced with the vaccines.

What I do not understand is how once we are vaccinated the virus would infect a vaccinated host and be able to shed active virus outside of the host body if the host can adapt and stop the virus before it is able to induce the COVID-19 disease.",CoronavirusUS,2021-02-08 21:52:28

I am having trouble managing my anger when I see people still not taking this seriously. It finds me when I'm looking at instagram stories, it finds me at the grocery store, it finds me when I think about how there will be no karmic justice for those not making any sacrifice. We're all paying the price for their selfishness with this unnecessarily prolonged pandemic. In the end, they're the exact ones who will talk about how much they had to give up.

My gf tells me to not hold on to the anger because it won't do anything; people will do what they want. She's right. But, for instance, last week at the grocery store a guy was walking around with his mask at his chin so I stared at him. He stared right back at me with a ""what are you going to do about it?"" look. It was a power move and he won.

Why can't we call this out? Why can't we publicly shame these people? Their actions are a public health hazard, not an expression of the first amendment. I could've talked to the manager but the employees keep their noses out of the mask anyway. I wish the general attitude of people in this country wouldn't be to live and let live, but rather to humiliate these selfish fucks. Maybe then they'd be less cavalier about endangering the public. 

There will be no justice.",CoronavirusUS,2021-02-09 11:17:15

If it’s still rare for people to be reinfected, then the majority of those who’ve had covid contribute towards herd immunity right?

The worry is that from surveys (saw an AP survey about this) a good third of people say they “probably” won’t get vaccinated (which I think will improve as it gets normalized and their friends and family get it), which will hurt chances for immunity. We are at 27.8 million cases of covid so far officially, but I’d wager we’ve probably had three times that or so with all the undocumented cases and people who had no symptoms or early on thought it was just a cold (certainly here in NY by me, tons of us are thought to have had it before we even knew what Covid was). My thinking is that certainly we have way more of a shot of reaching herd immunity than is discussed based on vaccinations alone.

**I want everyone to listen to me.**

The Chinese government is claiming that the new coronavirus infection (SARS CoV-2) was caused by the US.

So I want you all to watch this video.

I dug it up by searching the Internet.

This was broadcast on CCTV in China on December 28, 2018.

It is a documentary program about the Wuhan Institute of Virus Research.ppy they are in their research.

&amp;#x200B;

![video](xfy9yjnpgug61)

![video](6kjb0seigug61)

  Full **https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DugWOsXDjVE**

This broadcast shows how filthy and sloppy they are in their research.

1. they are playing with bats by touching them

2. they are bragging about being bitten by bats

3. They do not wear masks or caps in the laboratory.

4. They are exploring the cave in their daily clothes.

They are very cheerful and happy in their research, but they look very dangerous.

The WHO says there is nothing wrong with the Wuhan Virus Research Institute, but as you can see from this program, that is clearly not the case.

Dr.Shi Zhengli says that bat coronaviruses do not directly infect humans, but that is just a hypothesis.

Isn't there a possibility of causing a pandemic if this kind of research is conducted?

&gt; by JIM MANGIA 

&gt; *Vaccine Diaries is a series of dispatches exploring the rollout of COVID-19 immunizations.* 

&gt; Since last March, the 18 clinics I run in South and Central Los Angeles have been on the frontlines of COVID-19. Like many providers, we’ve faced unbelievable obstacles throughout the pandemic. To name a few: There were the shady businesses that popped up in the midst of the crisis to make a quick buck on masks and gloves, the scramble to shift appointments to telehealth when many of our patients do not have internet access, and the overall lack of guidance from the last presidential administration. Now that the COVID-19 vaccine is being rolled out, we’re facing another unexpected reality: mobs of angry vaccine chasers.

&gt; Our clinics serve more than 100,000 people, most of whom are Latino and Black, and many of whom are extremely low income. We are the largest COVID-19 vaccine provider in South L.A., and we have provided more than 20,000 vaccines over the past three weeks to health care workers and seniors—mostly people of color—from the area. Despite the fact that California is still in Phase 1B of vaccine distribution, in which largely only health care workers and seniors are qualified to receive it, every day, hundreds of mostly white, unqualified Westside residents are flooding our clinics.

&gt; They line up with lawn chairs and laptops before the vaccine clinic is even open. They demand to use our bathrooms, and their presence blocks seniors and health care workers from easily accessing our vaccine clinics. They heckle and intimidate our staff members, all of whom are Latino and/or Black. They threaten to “call the newspapers” because we won’t let them cut the line. One man even spit at a security guard who wouldn’t let him cut in front of an 82-year-old Black woman who had an appointment.

&gt; Over the past few weeks, we’ve been forced to double the number of security staff to manage the crowds. I suspect that stories of providers throwing vaccines away or doses going to people who are in the right place at the right time are to blame for all these people showing up. But our clinics never trash vaccines or give them out to lucky bystanders. We have a pool of local residents, mostly seniors, whom we would bring in if there were no-shows or leftover doses.

&gt; It’s not just physical mobs. These young white people have also figured out how to outsmart California’s vaccine appointment software. The system, which is clunky and inefficient, has a loophole that allows non–health care workers and nonseniors to make appointments by clicking “Other” when asked about their age and profession. They go onto the system as soon as the appointments are posted and book them up—there’s no way right now to automatically screen these people out. When health care workers finally get home from working all day and try to schedule an appointment, the slots are often all full.

&gt; The other week, several hundred first-shot appointments were made by self-identified white, non–health care workers for our clinics alone, preventing hundreds of qualified health care workers and seniors from accessing appointments. Luckily we caught it before the vaccine clinic operations began, since we noticed many appointments checked “Other” were accompanied with birthdates that made it clear they were not seniors. But we had to spend hours and hours of staff time calling to verify the patients’ information before canceling their appointments and replacing them with seniors who were on waitlists. The website clearly needs to be fixed, but we’ve been alarmed at the selfishness that has seeped through the cracks in the system. Gumming up a severely strained health care system as we try to deliver lifesaving resources to those who need them most could cost people their health, or worse.

&gt; L.A. is the epicenter of the pandemic, and Latino and Black people here have shouldered the burden in every way imaginable. It’s critical that we get these communities the vaccine quickly. Community leaders had to fight to ensure South L.A. was prioritized after initial plans were rolled out to send vaccines to hospitals and retail locations that would have been difficult for people here to access. That’s why, even when the vaccine becomes available to the wider population, people with the time and resources to travel should plan to seek out local clinics instead of flocking to other communities in hopes of getting a dose more quickly.

&gt; Throughout the pandemic, countless people have made selfish decisions that have ultimately just made it worse for everyone—from people who have refused to wear masks, to those who have knowingly traveled while having COVID-19, to those who have chosen to dine indoors despite warnings from health officials and pleading from restaurant workers to just order takeout instead. Unless you are being directly offered a vaccine that will otherwise spoil (and such stories, I think, are much rarer than they might seem), just be patient. Booking an online appointment when it’s not your turn, or staking out at a clinic, will simply disrupt the effort to combat COVID-19 and keep everyone safe. A vaccine is a public health tool, not a concert ticket.",CoronavirusUS,2021-02-11 11:50:06

You have people talking about comitting suicide if masks are still a thing by the end of 2021, with everyone upvoting it.  This comment has 39 upvotes:  


""Biden says Americans should prepare to wear masks until 2022.  


And here.....we.....go.  


Time to show ""the other side"" how ""pro science"" we are. Jesus Christ"".   


What does this even mean? How does it have 39 upvotes?  Am I tripping, or has it really, really noticably changed over here:

Firstly of course, this is **purely hypothetical**, there is no substantial evidence to suggest the mRNA vaccine does cause deaths. 

But let's say it does, why? Well chances are in the production of the vaccine, many corners had to be cut to speed up testing, maybe some dangerous shit got past. There's a reason vaccines takes years to produce, if you rush it, you potentially risk killing thousands. So why was there a need to rush it more than usual this time?

Because the situation has gotten **THAT** bad.

Hospital workers are overworked, 4,000 people are dying a day, that is almost two 9/11's PER DAY. Another 9/11 level tragedy happened today, and another will happen tomorrow. And then we have all the fucking frat boys and soccer moms, going absolutely apeshit because ""we want to go outside and socialize"". Then of course economic impacts, political shit, Asian American hate crimes.

Of COURSE the scientists are under intense pressure to speed up the process, every weekend that can be used to relieve stress and let doctors think clearer is another 4,000 deaths. Every extra day that is spent doing an extra check up just in case a variable is missed is another 4k deaths.

And can you imagine the mental distress to the people in your own field? Medical workers, witnessing death day after day, risking their own lives, and they only got proper masks MONTHS after the start of the pandemic?

This is all in the hypothetical that somehow the vaccine does cause deaths, even in the anti masker's own delusions they are STILL on the wrong side then.",CoronavirusUS,2021-02-14 01:49:05

From what I understand, the immunity from the COVID vaccine lasts around 90 days, same as the flu vaccine, which is why we get flu shots during flu season. Well, there’s no COVID season, and 90 days isn’t getting us even close to getting everybody vaccinated. In my head, our immunity will run out and then we could be reinfected because there’s still so many unvaccinated.

Why should we wait until 70-90% herd immunity via vaccine is reached before we THINK about a return to pre-covid life? By then the virus will likely have mutated to make vaccines useless. Just look at the South Africa and Brazil variants. They are already causing worry and its only February. Lets say we reach this herd immunity by end of summer. The amount of transmission is high in the US and a vaccine-evading variant forming is almost a certainty before then.

I think I might have very early on, but was barely symptomatic. So I want to buy one of the over-the-counter antibody/antigen tests which were announced two months ago. They were supposed to retail for $30.

However, none of my local drugstores carry them yet. Which of the test kits available online should I get?

Again, this is purely for my information, to let me know whether I've been an asymptomatic victim, to better inform my medical decisions in the future. I don't intend to delay or avoid vaccination when I'm eligible, no matter what the results, and so I want to find out relatively soon.

Given that, we know that children have had less exposure to these variants - and the *many variants out there yet to be found &amp; those that will arise later* \- so we know less about how it spreads among children and between young &amp; old.

These places were breeding ground for illness before covid. My coworkers and i were always sick. I have 3 facilities trying to get me to go do service on them and none of them are doing anything to protect there customers or staff. Be careful if you plan to go to one. If they do not have games off to force social distancing then they probably are not following any other regulations. The fabric of the laser tag vests is difficult to clean normally let alone disinfect from a virus. The the facility has bumper cars and they are leaving cars empty for covid do not ride. Bumper car arenas are sized to a set number of cars to prevent them from getting up to dangerous speeds if there is too many cars down you risk a car going too fast and causing concussion or even flipping over. Uvc germicidal lamps do exist but they are expensive and delicate. They also can cause cancer and break down rubber and plastic.

Bear with me here. I’m riled up. This has to be a fucking joke right?

So much about this article absolutely disgusts me but I just want to leave this here for the record because I’m astounded that young healthy NYC wait staff are not only being offered the vaccine but being FIRED for refusing the vaccine well before:

1) every individual in a higher risk category who wants the vaccine even has a chance to get the first dose and

2) healthcare students, who are having their clinicals SEVERELY disrupted.

Wait staff are really more important than students in healthcare fields like nursing and respiratory therapy who will SOON be out in the field to help combat this pandemic DIRECTLY?? Really? We are prioritizing getting people back to working and eating in restaurants before people who will soon be working in hospitals directly on covid patients??? !!!!!

While most of the country still can’t even get a vaccine if they WANT it, we have a waitress in NYC being FIRED over her choice not to get it???

How is it that NBC has been reporting on the weeks-long supply shortage even in NYC for the highest risk categories who want it but a WAITRESS is being FIRED for choosing not to get it? I’m opposed to making this a mandatory vaccination, but even if you’re not, she’s pregnant and it literally hasn’t been studied in pregnant women. How can this be legal whatsoever?

Whoever decided that restaurants opening is more important than the aforementioned populations is an absolute joke of a human being.

Full disclosure: I’m a *respiratory therapy* student. We were supposed to have clinicals 3-5 days per week the entire summer. What did we get? 0. We had clinical in the fall which only barely made up for what we missed in the spring, so we missed out on our 1 day per week clinical in the fall as well. We are supposed to have been in clinical since mid January, daily. How much have we gotten? 0. We will graduate with almost a full year less clinical than we are supposed to have. So, we will be out in the field later this year doing our best not to kill patients because of our fucking joke of an education. But it’s GREAT TO SEE THAT NYC RESTAURANT WORKERS HAVE SO MUCH VACCINE AVAILABLE TO THEM THAT THEYRE FIRING PEOPLE FOR TURNING IT DOWN.

What do you think accounts for this?","Clearly this is more than just the receding of a ""holiday surge"" -- we're back to where we were before Halloween.  Hospitalizations are also down to early November levels, so you can't blame this on a change in number or sensitivity of tests.  

The winter has been pretty cold and snowy in some regions -- maybe that's reducing mobility.  I sincerely doubt there's been a dramatic change in behavior otherwise.  I don't think masking changed significantly in the past couple months.  It's not schools -- they're more open than they were in October.

Cases are falling in virtually every state in the US, regardless of policy.

One possibility is that ""herd immunity"" is not a binary -- we may not be close to full ""herd immunity"" but enough people may either have had it or been vaccinated that there's a reduced number of available hosts, slowing the spread.

Another possibility is seasonality -- poorly understood, but it is observed in other resperatory viruses as well, a tendency to peak and then sharply decline sometime in winter.",CoronavirusUS,2021-02-19 12:55:56

My adult baseball league and beer league hockey leagues have both reopened over the summer. 

I choose not to play. I'm annoyed that my beer league hockey team told me not to expect a future spot on the team then and find another team. I'm a little pissed but for the most part I wasn't close to anyone on the team and finding another adult hockey team is easy (I have college club experience too, I'm a valued free agent).

But my adult baseball league I am pissed at. Especially that it's not even my team it's our local league president and league officers that I am pissed at. They didn't want anyone choosing not to play over the summer to rejoin the league. They kept insisting that their is no proof of COVID spreads from sports and anyone not playing is being wimpy. (My hockey team said something similar). 

I hated that they when and got political and I was removed from both the team GroupMe chat and the League GroupeMe chat as well as the private Facebook group for the league. 

It sucks because in many parts of the US, more adults play softball and not baseball. Many adult baseball leagues are small but the teams are full of players. There usually aren't enough free agents to form new teams out of. I know it took me a good 3 years of being on the waiting list to get on a team and play again. 

Then sadly my roller hockey league is gone as the rink says they are preeminently closed due to COVID.

Hi all. I recently had covid a few weeks ago (1/28-2/8). I felt like shit, but in the grand scheme of things, my symptoms were not terrible compared to others.

Yesterday, I received a call from public health saying that I would be eligible for the covid vaccine given the nature of my job and they offered appointment slots for me. I'm a 23-year-old with no underlying health conditions, but I'm considered an essential worker (social worker/homeless outreach). I informed them that I only just had covid a few weeks ago and asked if I should still get the vaccine or hold off until my natural immunity runs out. They couldn't give me a straight answer.

I've read mixed messages online, but it seems like I should be fine if I didn't receive an antibody treatment?

I scheduled my appointment for tomorrow afternoon but they told me I can reschedule if I need to. I don't know which covid vaccine they're administering.

COVID changed literally everything about our lives and even how we treat people subconsciously. And without even realizing it I was treating them differently and I still feel bad about it but I was also defending myself and protecting myself from getting sick. We’d share the same vicinity and they didn’t wear masks inside and often I’d hear them sneeze. We had a small square footage apartment i was living in the living room at the time. Not to mention before we went on lockdown I attend a university where thousands of students walk to everyday in crowded roads and hallways. And considering the virus entered the country a few months before we shutdown it means these students i lived with traveled to China 🇨🇳 RIGHT BEFORE THEY CAME BACK IN JAN 2020. I’m just mad that they were likely asymptomatic and didn’t tell me because I got really sick in February and was missing class and sleeping all day for weeks, and was confused why I was so fucking tired all of the time for no reason. So YEAH. TBH all world leaders failed us and I don’t feel that anyone knows what’s going on and hearing politicians lie about the virus all last year is not going to happen all over again this year. Now I’m skeptical of everything they throw out and I can’t feel safe knowing this virus is mutating faster than we predicted and is known to have mutants that are more contagious as a result of mass gatherings that are ongoing and seemingly harmless encounters up until the rest of us has to deal with the “country losing thousands of jobs” and “entering an economic recession”",CoronavirusUS,2021-02-20 07:54:12

Yes reducing the most risk per shot is good but it seems the state/feds aren’t going to throw open the doors to reopen when everyone over 65 is vaccinated. So that means younger people are going to be waiting for months and months longer.

They should split the vaccine supply in half, half to go through a highest risk first phase system, half to a lottery system that you enter. It would have the benefit of getting people some hope they’ll actually get the shot, and also would build the statistics of who is going to be anti-vax when it’s their turn.

I’m sick of hearing about the only way people my age are getting the shot is because they’re 

-a vet tech who lied about working in the “medical” field
-they knew someone who worked at a retirement home and the home has a [convenient] surplus of vaccines to distribute (how can you count how many people you have there so wrong)
-they’re a non-indigenous person who happens to work at a casino that had tons of vaccines poured into them

This whole rollout is just disgusting. I’m struggling to maintain my beliefs that the government can manage anything effectively, they have an unlimited budget and unlimited resources for this, it is a wartime effort and they’re shutdown by weather so that practically no vaccines have gone out this week?! 

Our state government knew the 2020 federal response was garbage in April/may, but they still couldn’t prepare for an effective vaccination program 8 months later. We have major tech and logistics companies that they could’ve partnered with to build a functional registration and distribution system, but they have this garbage web interface now.

Even watching states like California mess this up and then they announce a partnership with blue cross, which only exists so that the idiot bureaucrats can point the finger at someone else when they mess that up.

I’ve been taking this shit seriously for a full year now, following all the rules, I had a newborn baby during the first lockdown. But these idiots in charge fucking suck at this...

- Person 2 - works in school/doctor office/hospital setting as a translator. Is fully moderna vaccinated, never contracted and follows all hygiene protocols.

- Person 3 - works as dental assistant. contracted covid in March while at work recovered in 3 weeks, fully moderna vaccinated, follows all hygiene protocols (masks, shield, gloves) but still is working in quite close proximity to patients faces/breath/saliva.

I ran upstairs and barely made it to the toilet before I let go of an explosion that was 90% liquid. It has a few chunks in it, but that's it. It came on fast and out of nowhere.

It was very violent, and very alarming, especially since I ate plenty of finer today.

I ate a 1lb steak with steamed broccoli, cauliflower, and carrots tossed in butter approximately 30-40min ago. Could that have done it?

I'm just very alarmed by the severity of this bowel movement, and honestly I don't think this could happen to me under normal circumstances.

Is this covid?

She was telling me that they don't have to quarantine anymore so long as their symptoms are not severe, even though they continue to test positive using a PCR test.

Reading the CDC link, it appears that a significant number of COVID long-haulers shed virus that can be detected by a PCR test, but they are not ""replication-competent"" viruses. According to the published data, most of the long-haulers that shed ""replication-competent"" virus are ""severely immunocompromised"" patients. So it seems like patients that just have moderate symptoms and continue to shed virus that can be detected by a PCR test are deemed to be most likely to be shedding virus that is not replication competent, while patients that have symptoms who are ""severely immunocompromised"" may be shedding ""replication-competent"" viruses.

The most prominent study quoted by the CDC tested 285 long-haulers, but 108 of those, who were not ""significantly immunocompromised"" were not shedding ""replication-competent"" virus. The others shed viruses that were ""replication-competent.""

I assume that ""replication competent"" just means that there is a higher likelihood of replication from a virus that is replication competent instead of a virus that is not replication competent. In the Korean study, with the 285 long haulers, the 108 samples were tested using a viral cell culture, which produced negative results. Can someone explain what is going on here? How can a virus be shedding that is not ""replication competent""? Has the structure of the shed virus changed in some manner over time? Is there just less virus shed by patients who are not severely immunocompromised while people who are severely immunocompromised shed more virus?",CoronavirusUS,2021-02-22 11:50:45

&gt;Today, much of this GOF research has little to zero transparency, particularly what is funded by the NIH and conducted in China at the Wuhan Institute of Virology. This P4 lab in Wuhan (P4 is an exceedingly high biosafety level designation) is not only the first of its kind in China, but also the first in Asia. When it opened in 2017, U.S. scientists expressed concerns that, considering China’s opaque administrative structure, if one of those killer viruses “escaped” from the lab, it could cause a doomsday disaster. 

&gt;Gain-of-function (GOF) research involves experimentation that aims to (and actually does) increase the transmissibility and/or virulence of pathogenic viruses. GOF research typically involves mutations that confer altered functionality of a protein, molecule, or organism such as a virus. Such research (when safely conducted by responsible scientists) allegedly intends to improve the understanding of disease-causing agents, their interaction with human hosts, and/or even their potential to cause pandemics. But concerns about the safety of GOF studies have been voiced by numerous scientists from their very beginning. No matter how anyone justifies it or spins it, GOF studies manipulate pathogenic, deadly viruses to increase their transmissibility or virulence. Within the field of virology, these studies create ‘chimeric viruses’ defined as a new hybrid microorganism.  These are created by joining nucleic acid fragments, from two or more different microorganisms, in which each of at least two of the fragments contains essential genes necessary for replication.  This type of research has proven to be historically unsafe. Serious questions arise as to whether GOF research and the development of chimeric viruses are necessary for understanding viruses considering its potential for deadly contamination (pandemics) and bioterrorism. 



Here's some more: 

https://usrtk.org/tag/gof-research/ 

&gt;We do know, based on published research articles and U.S. federal grants to the EcoHealth Alliance for funding WIV’s coronavirus research, that WIV stored hundreds of potentially dangerous SARS-like coronaviruses, and performed GOF experiments on coronaviruses in collaboration with U.S. universities, and there were biosafety concerns with WIV’s BSL-4 laboratory.
But so far, there has been no independent audit of WIV’s laboratory records and databases, and little information exists about the WIV’s internal operations. The WIV has removed from its website information such as the 2018 visit of U.S. science diplomats, and closed off access to its virus database and laboratory records of the coronavirus experiments being conducted by WIV scientists. 

&gt;Researchers in professional networks associated with the Wuhan Institute of Virology (WIV) and EcoHealth Alliance, a U.S. non-profitthat has garnered millions of dollars from taxpayer-funded grants to collaborate with WIV on coronavirus research, have written that the novel virus likely originated via natural selection in animal hosts, with its reservoir in bats. This “zoonotic” origin hypothesis was further strengthened by claims that the new coronavirus outbreak started in a “wildlife” market in Wuhan, the Huanan seafood market, where potentially infected animals may have been sold. (However, at least one-third of the first cluster of infected patients, including the earliest known case of infection from December 1, 2019, had neither direct or indirect contact with the Huanan seafood market’s human and animal attendees.)
The zoonosis hypothesis is currently the prevailing hypothesis of origin. However, the zoonotic origin of SARS-CoV-2 has yet to be definitively established, and some researchers have pointed out that it rests upon contradictory observations that require further investigation.",CoronavirusUS,2021-02-22 17:21:37

At first it was one non-masker every other day, then it was a couple every other day, then there’s one everyday, and a couple more after that. Now it’s gotten so bad that the majority of our customers don’t wear masks. Maskers have become the minority and it’s a miracle that I haven’t brought any other dangerous diseases let alone COVID. A majority of the stores all over the area also never enforce masking, so most of the local population is not wearing masks. 

I wish there was more we could do about the masking situation. Corporate does not allow us to push maskless customers away since they prioritize sales over safety. We can offer masks to customers, but that’s as far as we can go (90% of customers have turned the masks down). I’ve also noticed that corporate has stopped sending cleaning supplies, so we no longer have wipes or sprays left to clean the counters, carts, baskets, and pen pads. I have no clue how to report this sort of practice and abuse against employees (both our store and other shops). I guess it wouldn’t matter anyway though if the majority of the area is non-masking. It scares me though. Jobs are hard to find, so I need to keep it for the money, but yet my father is old an vulnerable.

I’m sorry, I had to get that off of my chest. I wish this pandemic could be over, but at the rate it seems this whole thing is going that could be a lifetime from now. I’m trying my best to be cautious, but I’m just worried that I might end up in the wrong place at the wrong time and bring something deadly home.",CoronavirusUS,2021-02-22 19:14:32

Then they switch to online instruction for an extended winter break from December to January. Meanwhile, we keep indoor dining closed from August to October, then re-allow it from November to February as outdoor dining becomes unsustainable due to the decreasing temperatures. We also close non-essential retail from October to Thanksgiving weekend, then reopen it for Black Friday and holidays, before shutting it back down in January. (These dates are just examples, they don't need to be 100% exact, what matters is that they're clear and available to the public.)

All this is plotted out in advance (preferably before autumn) so that there are no surprises. And of course, a stronger, more blanket lockdown would still be on the table just in case.

Many lives were lost and everyone's lives were changed. None of us have ever experience anything to this magnitude. At first, we thought that this was basically just another flu. As we witnessed the hospitalizations and death toll skyrocket and our hospitals become increasingly overwhelmed, we started to realize that this was something more serious. However, we never expected to last a whole year nor did we expect to see this large of a death toll.

As of today, we have officially lost 500,000 American lives to the Coronavirus. That is half a million people. Half a million people who had hopes, dreams, families, and things to look forward to. 

This is not about your (or anyone's) personal position on lockdowns, mask wearing, or vaccines. This is about the idea that we have lost 500,000 Americans needlessly and unnecessarily. This is about the poor state of our leadership and our general lack of humanity. This is about our healthcare workers and first responders who have worked tirelessly to go on the frontlines every day to preserve human life.

Let’s talk about the flip-side. We all feel the gravitational pull back to a sense of normalcy so I am curious what justifications have you designed to fit your narrative and needs? 

My wife and I are in our 30’s and have two young children. We have laid low since last March. WFH, no social gatherings (except occasional outdoor distanced meetup at park), virtual learning for kids, etc. We have not visited family or friends through 99% of this pandemic. Many of our friends and family have moved on like others here, and while many have gotten sick with Covid-19 many come out fine in the end. Our parents (who were our concern mainly) have been vaccinated at this point. We have made it this far and my disciplined approach often can lead to a slight bias and since I can summon a list of reasons it appears “not safe” to see friends and family (in my sleep )at this point, I am curious what case someone would make for safely reentering society in a world where I feel the public domain is safer than friends/family domain? I feel this way because public domain people are trying to practice some level of care via mask, distance, etc. However, it’s like friends and family are embarrassed about masks in a social setting and as a result shun the idea to appear decisive and in control of the fearless life; I call it a coping mechanism. 

Again, help me understand why “younger” “healthy” families truly have a different risk factor at the end of the day.",CoronavirusUS,2021-02-23 06:05:39

Or anytime someone says that they aren't sure if schools should reopen until kids are vaccinated that people respond saying that there's no proof that children spread the virus and downvote everyone.

The funny thing is that none of these accounts are new. Many of them are 5+ years old with over 1000 to 10000 karma. Who seem to be active posters in other normal subs like gaming or personal finance or superbowels.

Am I sick of lockdowns? YES!

My roommates think that means they can go over to their friends and families houses and NOT wear masks as long as there’s only 2 households there at once and less than 5 ppl.

Cdc guidelines clearly state to do social gatherings outside when possible and to wear masks when within 6 feet of someone else or in doors.

I have been feeling a lot of sadness and grief recently and I need to write it out. Read or don’t read. These patients will forever hold a special place in my heart.

To all my patients who never made it out of the hospital. The ones who came in thinking they would be discharged after a week or so on oxygen. To the ones who made me promise them I wouldn’t let them die, and then died weeks later...spending days fighting for every breath only to eventually die sedated on a ventilator. To the ones who never got the chance to say goodbye to their families. To the patients who’s last meal was jello and Italian ice, not knowing it would be the last time eating physical food. To the patient who never got to go to Yellowstone like they wanted. To the patient that was in the middle of a vintage car remodel. To the 24 year old girl whose parents had to watch die on Zoom. To following every precaution yet still contracting the virus from someone who refused to do so. I am sorry. I wish I could’ve done more. I’m sorry this virus exists. I’m sorry that your life ended before you had a chance to live it. I’m sorry I was the last person you had to see before you died, I know there was someone else you would’ve wanted with you. I wanted nothing more for you to return home to your vintage thunderbird. I wanted nothing more for you to go to Yellowstone with your brother who’s in the Army. I wanted nothing more for you to return back to your life as a 20 year old girl. I will never forget you. I hope you are resting now. Peaceful.

I don’t think I will ever be the same. I’ve seen more people die over the past 12 months than I was prepared for. I got close to these patients before they died. They depended on me for hope yet they were stuck in a hospital knowing death was coming. I tried to give them hope and I tried to make them feel safe. I broke many of the promises I made to them and I can’t let it go. So I am sorry. I just wanted you guys to know.

Edit: thank you to the amazing and kind humans who commented on this. You have restored a small piece of faith in humanity for me. Your kind words mean more to me than you know. I wrote this as a journal entry that I was too scared to post on my social media for I do not want to deal with the conspiracy theorists/anti maskers of the world. This is a very personal experience and my feelings are very delicate right now. You are amazing for even reading this as I honestly didn’t think anyone would.

This sounds so stupid. If a kid gets tested on the 10th of Feb, it doesn't mean they are Covid free the whole month of March.

Overview:  All on campus students (Cohorts, sports, clubs, testing) will be required to provide COVID test results at a minimum of 1 time a month.  (Students will be able to submit a test result at any time during that calendar month.  Example March 1-March 31 – to continue in person for the month of April.)  Families may choose to have COVID testing at a site of their choice or the school offered BD Veritor Antigen testing.   
 
COVID Testing Plan: 
 
Grades K-4  
	•	Testing will be offered on “Flex Wednesday” 
	•	Testing will be conducted as a “walk-up” event instead of previous drive-thru events for parents/guardians to bring their child.  Families will be sent the sign-up and can sign up for March 10 or March 17 (2pm-5pm) 
	•	Families will park in front of building #21 (Middle School) and walk up to the main lobby.  Please bring your completed paperwork with you or additional paperwork will be provided at the event.   
	•	Any student that has had COVID-19 in the last 90 days must speak with their building level RN as they may not be able to test at this time.",CoronavirusUS,2021-02-25 13:11:20

I officiate sports (basketball and ice hockey - mostly ice hockey) for extra income. I haven't officiated in a year. I'm about at the end of our emergency fund and we need to start bringing in more money. I am now two weeks after my 2nd dose of Moderna. If I do go back to officiating, I would wear a mask, though it would not be as effective as normal situations, and most of the other participants would not be wearing one.

Here is my bubble, grouped into households:

* 2 people who are 63 and vaccinated; 1 person who is 35 and had Covid in November
* 2 people who are 61 and 67, both vaccinated
* 1 person who is 28 and vaccinated; 1 person who is 27 and should be vaccinated ""soon""
* My spouse who is vaccinated, and breastfeeding our infant (11 months).
* Eventually it would be opened up to other households that are fully vaccinated.

I'm trying to determine if we're at a safe enough spot or not for me to get back to officiating.

* Chances of exposure are difficult to determine. My states positivity rate is dropping. The 7-day rolling positivity rate has been below 5% for a month, and the past few days have been below 3%. But in a given day of officiating, there could be 100 kids aged 13-19 that I'm exposed to. So eventually, I'm 100% certain I'd be exposed to someone who is positive. I don't know if that is every game or not, but lets assume that it is. It isn't often that I'm within 6 feet of someone on the ice or the court, and the longest exposure there would be 2 minutes, but the games are over an hour and people are breathing heavily.
* Chances of my getting infected, as I'm 2 weeks post-vax? Pretty low - We'll say 5%
* Chances of my getting anything more than a mild or asymptomatic infection? Probably 0%
* Chances of transmitting it? Well, unknown. I'd guess that there is a .01% chance of spreading it without being infected, and a 50% chance of spreading it with being infected. So a 2.51% chance of spreading it. But... Who could I transmit it to?  

   * Other participants in the game, but as callous as this sounds, I don't care about them. They've made their decision to play, and it is much more likely they get infected from a teammate or an opponent than me.
   * Everybody in my bubble who has been vaccinated... Well, pretty low chance. Lets call it 0%. (.05\*.05=.0025)
   * The 2 adults who haven't been vaccinated, I can wear a mask around them. We'll call it 0% again (no calculation, because masks are all different)
   * My infant child... Well, there is my worry.

So, that was a long way of saying, what is the risk of transmitting this to my child? As mentioned above, I'm guestimating a 5% chance of my getting infected, and a 50% chance of transmitting it resulting in a 2.5% chance of my child getting it from me. However, that is assuming that she has no antibodies. It is looking like that won't be the case. We don't have hard data on this, only anecdotes, but they're promising: [Vaccinated mom passed antibodies to breastfed son](https://www.wcnc.com/article/news/health/coronavirus/vaccine/mom-who-received-covid-19-vaccine-says-she-was-able-to-pass-along-antibodies-to-her-son-through-breast-milk/275-b5681ed7-df44-4f53-b78f-9a38259a3741). Additionally, I'd have to assume based on what we know from other vaccines that even if IgG isn't transmitted, some IgA would be transmitted, inferring some level of protection. And add to that, [women who were infected with Covid are conferring some level of protection to their breastfed infants](https://mbio.asm.org/content/12/1/e03192-20), it stands to reason that women who were vaccinated would do the same.

So... Is this a reasonable risk to take? Is there something I'm missing?",CoronavirusUS,2021-02-25 17:30:05

First time poster. I have a question about herd immunity. So, in the US, we just hit 50 million getting at least one shot. (Myself included, yay!)

My understanding is that we need \~250 million people, (80% of the population) vaccinated to achieve herd immunity, so my question is: Do we reach herd immunity when we reach \~250 million with their first dose of the vaccine, or do they need to be fully vaccinated (As in, got the Second shot)?

Much thanks!!!!",CoronavirusUS,2021-02-25 22:39:38

Yeah, yeah I read you can do this or do that and eliminate that problem, but I never do and now the aggravation seems to be part of the ritual when going out in the crowded spaces.  But I have known all along that it probably has been helping to reduce my chances of getting the Covid as recently validated in a study

[Risk of Corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19) among spectacles wearing population of Northern India | medRxiv](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.02.12.21249710v1) 

That is showing a pretty significant conclusion stating: The present study showed that the risk of Covid-19 was about 2-3 times less in spectacles wearing population than the population not wearing those. 

Okay, so there it is now validated as the “right thing to do if you really care” but I would be willing to bet that even with the more infectious variants now spreading about, that most people still won’t bother to take the step to wear eye protection.

Herd immunity by vaccination can be reached by fall assuming vaccinations pick up the pace. Variants that are concerning are being reported. I am not that concerned about the current variants due to vaccines being able to prevent severe disease caused by variants. The current amount of transmission of the virus is what is concerning, more so if the vaccines dont prevent infection effectively.

I was sitting in my apartment and I was starting to get pretty concerned about this covid thing. I tried to take everything I read with a grain of salt, but I was concerned about how covid was looking. By the end of march I had decided I would social distance and only go out when it was necessary. 

As covid got more and more to be a problem I felt like I had made the right decision. I was social distancing, wearing mask the few times I needed to go out. I did curbside for groceries. I moved in with some family due to financial reasons (not the best job market right now). 

I don't think I'm being paranoid, Covid is serious and should be taken seriously. Which brings me to my biggest frustration.

I am the only person in my social circle who is following any guidelines not mandated by their job (With the exception of the family I live with). My extended family acts as if its all not a big deal. My friends in town never even stopped going to bars in large crowds. Pretty much every single non-medical organization where I live is pushing against the guidelines as hard as they can rather than try to limit spread. 

I try to be a realist. Right if everyone around me seems to think one way, what are the chances that they are ALL wrong and I just happen to be the person who is right? Isn't that sort of arrogant? Yet at the same time, I can't ignore the reality I can't ignore all the medical professionals. 

Am I insane to think not potentially spreading a deadly virus is more important than a church play for kids? That its more important to prevent spread than it is to go eat out somewhere?

Ive made sacrifices. I'm 28, I was finally getting to a place where I had built somewhat of a life for myself that I didn't hate. I had community, I had friends, I had goals, I had a general direction, and I had some small measure of independence. Now? I have none of those things in anything but name. I sacrificed all that because it was better to give up some of lifes pleasures in order to help be safe and not catch and/or spread the sickness. 

And everyone acts like i'm suppose to fucking respect all these grown adults acting like children who won't put aside their selfishness in order to meet the VERY low bar of not being a shitty person. 

&gt;That evening the king ordered a golden goblet to be filled from the
well.  And when it was brought to him he drank deeply, and gave it
to his lord chamberlain to drink.
 
&gt;And there was great rejoicing in that distant city of Wirani,
because its king and its lord chamberlain had regained their reason.

1. Restrict the information shown so that there is no need to listen to data not related to user’s locality. The country is detected automatically. The state and locality can be typed in. Full name is not required, you can type cal for California and su for Sutter County. This typing concludes once-off setup.
2. Ensure fresh data can be fetched by refreshing the tracker webpage. The idea behind refreshing is that you keep the tracker opened in a browser’s tab and refresh it from time to time. Refreshing is especially convenient on portable devices since it can usually be initiated by a gesture.

Sighted users wishing to check local coronavirus case counts quickly can find this functionality useful as well.

There are some activities I had been staying away from entirely because I just don’t see how they aren’t inherently higher risk, such as routine dentist visits (since everyone is unmasked and there are things happening there that aerosolize spit... I know the US dental marketing organizations disagree but the WHO advises otherwise). 

Air travel was another one. (I realize this is lower risk, but I generally don’t believe US data on this because I don’t think we really have any data. When you look at Canada and other countries that are actually doing contact tracing, there have been some on aircraft transmissions). I have been avoiding but I might travel a few times a year now. 

I’m thinking I’m going to resume these types of activities.

I'm a 27 y/o male with no pre-existing health conditions. As I understand it, the vaccine does not prevent you from being a carrier of COVID or spreading it. 

In my mind, the risk of taking a vaccine that hasn't been tested for a significant amount of time (that could have unknown side effects down the road) vs just getting COVID (which I will likely survive just fine), doesn't add up. Additionally, reading people's experiences with the vaccine thus far, it seem as though the sickness that it causes post-injection can be just as bad (if not worse) than having COVID itself for young people.

If the vaccine prevented people from carrying/spreading COVID, I could see the benefit to having everyone take it. But as it stands, I'm not seeing the overall benefit for people who aren't elderly/at risk. Yes, COVID has a chance of giving you long term ailments, but people taking the vaccine have also reported continued headaches/ailments ever since receiving it. Can someone explain why taking the vaccine is the better choice? Thanks!

If it's the state governments, then that varies between state and state so it's hard to make an over encompassing statement about ""the entire country"" because a singular state government issued a lockdown in their state. 

Also as well, I know the police are well known for being big covid skeptics and otherwise unwilling to enforce the lockdown as well.

And regardless of the state and federal government, if the police choose not to enforce it, then I don't see how there was even a lockdown if everybody can just unlock it.

My wife and I got our first round of the Pfizer vaccine yesterday (higher risk), and are scheduled for the second in three weeks. We have an infant at home, and are hoping she picks up some antibodies from breastfeeding.

Given the above, and assuming continued precaution, will it be safe for me to go back to the office next month? My office is in a location that is fully staffed, open to the public, and has a shared ventilation system (the offices next to me are definitely circulating the same air). I would have to get there by train, and possibly also a small bus.

My main concern is bringing the virus home to my child and wife, but I obviously would prefer not to die or end up with long-term health complications.

I've been WFH for a year now due to higher risk, and although I've been more productive than usual, the political pressure to come back isn't going away.

Examples:

We have set up the site in way that everyone who is getting tested has their own area while the rest can get in line and wait for their turn while social distancing, unless they came together. The test requires the patient to cough 3-5 times. I cannot tell you how many people have walked in front of someone else coughing, to show us with their phones that they have an appointment. Or they wait right behind some random person that may or may not have it, and the person in front is coughing. Time and time again we have to ask them to stand back and get in line, and most will give you this very indignant look. 

But my favorite one is when people try to come inside the trailer when there’s a big ass sign that says “STAFF ONLY.” You’re literally getting yourself exposed and then look offended when we ask you to step out and away. We all wear our PPE all day so we feel safe but someone with just a mask wouldn’t be as safe.

And every day is the same thing. Every. Single. Day. Some people are “regulars,” and completely disregard all the signs or ignore our directions. 

Some people bring kids and can’t control them, they run around everywhere and too close to other people who may have it. 

Another thing is we close when are scheduled to close. If you fly tomorrow why the fuck did you show up after closing hours. 
We’ve heard all kinds of sad stories and excuses: I need it for work, just got exposed, I’ll miss my fly, I got lost, etc and these are the ones who think it’s okay to walk into the trailer when we are doing the closing procedures. So now you’re exposed, potentially infected and will potentially infect everyone in that plane and where else you go because you’re not gonna get tested until 1-3 days before you fly back.


Un-fucking-believable.

I firmly believe some people get infected when they come to get tested. We also can’t get too close to anyone as a precaution and we always have to ask people not to get too close, and most look offended. It is so disheartening. One year has passed and it’s sad to see how many people don’t take this seriously. 

At this rate it feels like we will continue dealing with this pandemic for another year at least. I have spoken to other employees about their locations and apparently it’s worse in certain areas. Some people are straight up careless but apparently entitled too, like a “Karen” who refuses to move back. We’ve only had one family where they were all hanging out and refused to wear their masks. I wonder, if they don’t think covid is real, then why the fuck are you getting tested?",CoronavirusUS,2021-03-03 10:08:59

I've heard that younger and healthier people have harsher side effects, like higher fevers, because they have more robust immune systems. Is a harsher reaction indicative of being ""healthy""?

I've heard that people who get a strong reaction with the first dose (rather than the second) likely had asymptomatic covid. The first shot is essentially the second shot for this group of people since they already a low level exposure. Is there any truth to that?

I've also heard it speculated that the people who react the strongest to the vaccine would've probably had an incredibly rough time if they did contract covid. Is there any truth to that? Luckily, the chances of someone having severe covid after being vaccinated is very low so we will likely never know.

Texas removing the mask mandate is very bad. More people will get sick! If we did this bad with people wearing masks, what do you think will happen without masks? Hospitals are already flooded with sick people and there is a new strain of the virus. Businesses that want to stay safe and keep wearing masks will be in danger. A Mexican restaurant wanted everyone to wear masks before coming in. The customers threatened to call ICE on the staff. There are gonna be more cases. Just in a day Texas had 2,400 new cases! Just in Texas. This already shows what a huge number will happen during spring break. Other people say that this is good. They can finally go out normally. That this is also good for the economy.

I'm a 31y old female in good health. 
I was stabbed yesterday around noon and after waiting around for 15 minutes, I headed home. Around 8p my body sudden felt exhausted. It was a little surreal bc my brain wasn't tired, but my body was done. I sat down on the couch and that's when the chills started. 

I live in Florida, so it was probably around 68 last night. I was shaking like I was naked and it was 20 degrees outside. My core was shaking, my legs were shaking, my hands, and my mouth. I piled under every warm blanket I could find.

What was super weird is I didn't feel miserable. I just was aware that I was freezing and my body was tired. 

I was also insanely horny which is not something I ever feel when I'm sick. (My hubs is always esp horny when he doesn't feel good and I always thought that was odd.)

We headed upstairs and after some fun I fell asleep with a sweatshirt, 2 regular blankets, and a weighted blanket on me. I get nightmares when I'm overheated at night, so I always try to be cold. I was still cold with all the layers (in florida). I probs asked my hubs 20+ times if I had a fever, but he said no.

Again I wasn't miserable. My brain was just like ""oh your body is cold and tired"" nbd.

I wasn't miserable until the sleeping. We went to bed early, probs 930ish. I was tossing and turning and finally woke up thinking it had to almost be morning only to see the clock said 12:21a. My back was sore, I got vertigo when I had to get up to pee, and all my limbs felt super achey.

This happened all night. Tossing and turning, wake up thinking it was morning. Dizzily walk to the to the bathroom 2:30a, 4:30a, and 6:30a. At some point I took off the sweatshirt and weighted blanket and heard my hubs say my skin was on fire. Guess I did get that fever.

It's morning now and my temp feels fine, but I'm still achey and I have a headache coming on. I'm also insanely thirsty.

I am so thankful for the vaccine and glad I was able to get it per the new teacher rules. I'll probably have to cancel some classes today, but absolutely worth it.",CoronavirusUS,2021-03-09 07:00:23

I’m looking for advice on what next steps I need to take or if anyone can give me advice on which of these tests I should trust more. 
      I was volunteering to be a part of a clinical research study at a lab. To be a part of the study you had to test negative for COVID. They tested me on a Friday with a nasal swab test they sent off to a lab. That test came back negative. The following Tuesday I was checking in and they did two consecutive nasal swab tests, one that had a rapid response time and another they sent to off to a lab. The rapid response came back positive for COVID, and so I began quarantining. I just found out today that the test they sent off to the lab had come back Negative.
      I have been largely asymptomatic besides one day where I had a temperature that peaked at 99.5 Fahrenheit on about my 5th day of quarantine and lasted for less than 12 hours. I can potentially attribute that to a session of binge eating I’d had the day before, as the day after I was feel kind of ill. 
     So this leaves me with a few questions. Would one of these tests be more trustworthy over another? Is a false positive or negative more likely from one of these tests? What would be a potential next step be for figuring out what to do next?
     Right now I’m planning on getting an antibody test sometime next week after my quarantine period has ended and I should have developed antibodies. Thanks to anyone who has any answers, studies, or articles to help me figure this out.",CoronavirusUS,2021-03-09 17:12:45

Sorry if this is the wrong place to post, but I'm a little confused about herd immunity and the COVID-19 vaccine. I'm hoping someone can help explain this to me.

My understanding is that herd immunity prevents infection in non-immune people by lowering the risk of them coming into contact with another non-immune person (assuming random mixing). The idea is that there are vaccinated people between you and another unvaccinated person that prevent you from becoming infected (as transmission stops with the vaccinated individual). 

But for COVID-19, vaccinated people may still be asymptomatic transmitters. If any vaccinated person can still transmit the virus, won't unvaccinated people always be at reasonably high risk of catching it?

My theory is that there is a general hesitancy to rank them because it would effectively destroy any hope of skeptics getting the 3rd or 2nd place ones, and this message of “anything is good” will ensure wider spread of vaccine acceptance.

Curious, has anyone come to a solid conclusion of which is best, assuming all 3 are free and readily available for a person?

Hopefully this will be the first step in other states with high vaccination rates can soon follow suit (New Mexico has the next highest rate).  Nationally, it is anticipated that enough vaccines will be available for all Americans by sometime in late spring.

I believe these policies are based on national guidelines, also being followed by many other states.

I can't understand how this makes any actuarial sense. [Being overweight adds about 50% more risk of death](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/08/health/coronavirus-obesity-weight.html) and [smoking adds about 100% (double) the risk](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7647838/#:~:text=Mortality%20among%20current%20smokers%20was%2032.1%25%2C%20whereas%20mortality%20among%20former,a%20non%2Dstatistically%20significant%20increase). However, by contrast, [those in the 50-64 age range have a 2600% (26X) increased risk of death compared to people in the 18-29 age range and (40000%) 400X more risk than those under 18. ](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/need-extra-precautions/older-adults.html)

So, obviously, age is a far more significant risk factor in predicting death than the many of these other so-called ""co-morbidities."" 

I should also point out that according the CDC, [74% of the adult population is overweight](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/fastats/obesity-overweight.htm) and [fits the definition for prioritization](https://www.newsobserver.com/news/coronavirus/article249695408.html).  How is prioritizing 74% of the population really any prioritization at all?

Also, NC's guidelines prioritize those who have smoked 100 cigarettes in their lifetime, which, of course, is impossible to validate. So, essentially, in the latter stages of the rollout, there is no prioritization. It's essentially just a free-for-all. 

Not only do these policies make no actuarial sense but they are also completely impractical in in terms of execution.

It would be so easy to prioritize based on age, the dominant risk factor. Age is easily provable with an ID and without a doctor's note. And it can be used to gradually move through population by decile, rather than opening up to 80-85% of the population all at once (when you add overweight people with smokers and all the other conditions). 

I suppose this raises the interesting question as to why health officials have such an aversion to age-based prioritization when it would obviously save the most lives and be the easiest to implement. 

Is it just easier to feel empathy for smokers and overweight people? Any theories?",CoronavirusUS,2021-03-10 15:14:31

I got my first dose of the Moderna vaccine today. 

Most of my family (except my immediate household) has been very against the vaccines from the get go. Especially my mother. She has been sending me conspiracy theories and all kinds of random videos and news articles since the pandemic began, and I mostly learned to ignore them. Its all been crazy stuff, like she's been doomsday prepping since last June, warning me about some catastrophe that would happen in December, that kind of thing. She has acted as if I've lost my mind for even considering the vaccine. Literally, she said ""I don't even know who you are anymore.""

That said, I ignored all the anti-vaccine stuff. Got my first shot today. Then for some reason clicked on a video she had sent me a couple of weeks ago, which ended up being about antibody dependent enhancement and how everyone who got vaccinated will die months from now. 

I did a search and found some stuff, but I need to talk about it because my anxiety is now through the roof. Should I be regretting getting this vaccine? Maybe this is one piece of info from my mom I shouldn't have ignored? How likely is it that this ADE will happen 6 months, a year, 2 years from now? Ugh. Help?",CoronavirusUS,2021-03-10 21:10:37

The vaccine is also 97% effective at preventing severe disease and death. It was also found to be effective against the UK Variant. Not enough South African variant is present in Israel for useful data on the vaccine’s effectiveness against that variant. And if you’re still hesitant about getting vaccinated, unvaccinated individuals were 44 times more likely to develop symptomatic COVID-19 and 29 times more likely to die from COVID-19 than those who had received the vaccine.

Israel made an agreement to give Pfizer certain patient data about vaccinations in return for enough vaccines from the company for the entire country (most western countries would not be willing to do that, but having been in a near constant state of war since its modern founding, Israelis have a different view on civil liberties and the needs of the state). So that’s why we don’t have similar data on the Moderna vaccine. But since the Moderna and Pfizer vaccines are both based on mRNA technology, the results from Israel give reason to be hopeful for the Moderna vaccine as well.

Out of curiosity, I followed the link to a page with information on eligibility, where, after confirming with the county health department, I found out I am indeed eligible to receive the vaccine as someone who works for a farm equipment manufacturer (food supply chain). This nuance of Wisconsin's list of Tier 1B Workers was previously unknown to me.

I'm excited about the possibility of getting vaccinated much sooner than I thought I would be able to, but I'm also unsure of the moral weight of claiming a vaccination right now in my current situation. My specific job (advertising) has been successfully transitioned to a WFH setup for most of the past year, and my wife's (currently ineligible) has been, too. Overall, even though the pandemic has caused a lot of stress, we have managed to stay healthy and keep our general quality of life. This situation should remain the same for the foreseeable future. On top of that, I do believe demand of eligible recipients still outweighs vaccine supply in my area.

Would I be wrong to go get the vaccine right now?",CoronavirusUS,2021-03-11 14:29:56

It's just under the current circumstances, this is an option I have and it's been interesting learning about both. 

What do I like about Moderna? 

It's clear that Moderna has a higher efficacy rate than J&amp;J (95% vs 66%) for moderate cases. Having long-term symptoms concerns me (even for those that are originally asymptomatic), and having a vaccine that has a high efficacy rate is a big plus here. 

What do I like about J&amp;J? 

J&amp;J was tested against the new variants, whereas the mRNA shots were not. Studies point that Phizer shots are a whopping 2/3 less effective against the new variants, and Moderna is six-folds less effective. I'm afraid these new variants will eventually be the norm. 

J&amp;J is also very successful (85%) in preventing the most severe cases and 100% effective in stopping hospitalizations and deaths.",CoronavirusUS,2021-03-12 12:07:07

I’m a 33 year old woman living with a controlled autoimmune disorder that received my first dose (Moderna) in eastern USA. I am reacting to the first dose, and we believe I had coronavirus originally in December of 2019 — I had the “flu” twice in a 1.5 month span. The time we believed I had coronavirus, I had been traveling 70% of the time for work and was too scared to be hospitalized while away from home. I had most of the symptoms. 

I had read on MedPageToday that recipients of the first dose that react to it, most likely had the virus already as the immune system recognizes it. I cannot find any studies that would prove that — or prove otherwise.

Has anyone got any guidance on this? I am having flu like symptoms, fatigue, chills.",CoronavirusUS,2021-03-13 18:14:16

I gave my passport (we’ve moved a few times in the past few years and I never updated my license), and husband gave his license with a different address. 

We had no issue, no one questioned anything. I’ve been looking up articles about some people lying about health conditions to get vaccinated now, which could get back to your insurance company. But we realized that theoretically, anyone could just lie about their job. Obviously everyone should wait until they are up, but I think about people like my parents, who are 64, but even my mother who is overweight and has high blood pressure, hasn’t been vaccinated yet because my home state is one of the last in line for vaccinations (Go Missouri!). 

But then I’ve read that in places where the population is high and vaccines are more scarce, it may be more difficult, like NYC.

A good amount of employees at my company are considered frontline/essential and work in warehouses/distribution across the country, but I’m part of the population that works in a corporate office (remotely). We’ve just sent out one broad email to all employees letting them know that the vaccine is covered under our health plan, encouraged it (but didn’t use any aggressive wording) and linked to the CDC site to learn more.

I am not high risk (i don’t think) but i do a have a autoimmune disease that’s been in remission. The only reason i haven’t just been ignoring my parents pleas and seeing people is because i know they could die if they got it, but i am not worried about me or my siblings (11,17) if we get it. SO after both of them are fully vaccinated will it be safe for me to start seeing friends more often and without masks? The only reason i would think it wouldn’t be safe were if there parents were high risk but none of them really believe or care about corona so i know they won’t stop me from seeing them. thanks for reading.",CoronavirusUS,2021-03-15 23:50:41

Do others have some concerns on vaccinating kids with a new mRNA vaccine?  We don’t and won’t know the long term affects.  There is a good reason why vaccines are approved over a decade.  I understand the need for the vaccine for the older population.  But is the need to rush the vaccine for children beneficial?  The trials have admitted that long term reproductive health has not been evaluated fully for the vaccine. 

Here is a good article-
https://www.statnews.com/2021/02/03/kids-dont-need-covid-19-vaccines-to-return-to-school/

“The vaccines’ harm-benefit profile may be suboptimal in kids. The last consideration I offer is that we do not know if a vaccine will have a favorable risk-benefit profile, gain FDA approval, and be palatable to parents. Consider what might happen to a million kids who receive a vaccine that works as well in kids as it does in adults with comparable side effects.

Assume the same 95% relative risk reduction seen in studies of the Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna vaccines in adults. The vaccine might save one life for every 1 million kids who get it.

At the same time, assume the vaccine has side effects comparable to adults for the second Moderna dose in adults. In that scenario, 45,000 kids will develop severe headaches requiring analgesics and interfering with daily living, 14,000 will have a fever higher than 104 degrees F for less than a day, and 880 will have this fever last for more than a day. This happens not because these side effects are common — they are rare — but because you have to vaccinate 1 million kids to save one life.

My point is that the vaccine side effects, which are absolutely justified in adults — full disclosure, I have been vaccinated — may be a tough sell to children and parents simply because the absolute benefit to kids is very small given the low absolute risk of developing severe Covid-19 or dying from it.”

Also the indemnification of vaccine makers is extremely questionable.  This needs to be reevaluated for children.  Given the risk profile for kids, the testing process should be lengthened considerably.


https://theintercept.com/2020/08/28/coronavirus-vaccine-prep-act/

“And while people harmed by vaccines for other diseases are able to file claims with the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program, which was established in 1986, the PREP Act now bars anyone who feels they were harmed by a vaccine for the coronavirus from using the program.

I posted this on the NYS and Long Island forums.

I’m a recent college grad and the first job I landed was with a temp agency. I was forwarded a post on Facebook promising long hours, great pay, lots of experience. The Job was for the NYS Vaccination effort. Positions for Data entry/ administration paid $27, and greeters/registration paid $22. The hours where 7Am to 7Pm. I got hired for data entry within 25 minutes. This was the first sign this was too good to be true. The paperwork and training took roughly 3 hours and next thing I knew I was at work a few days later.

At the start the site wasn’t that bad. We got feed 3 meals a day. The food was catered from local restaurants. We also got plenty of time “on standby” (essentially a break). Depending on the position you could work 30 minutes on 30 minutes off \[traffic/flow control\], 1 hour on 1 hour off \[registration/check in/greeters\], 2 hours on 2 hours off \[nurses/scribes\].

My first day on the site made me feel like I was in a doomsday movie. Giant tents. Soldiers and cops around every corner. Generators humming in your ear. Everyone masked up. As I sat in the cold, I realize this was a part of my new daily routine.

My expectations had fallen short, but this is where things got sus. As I wondered around looking for data entry I got told “you’re not qualified for data entry. We will put you at scribe. Once you have credentials \`we will move you to data entry.” I said ok and set out to learn how to scribe.

Being a scribe was not that bad. The worst part was my hands. At the start of the vaccination effort all paperwork was done by hand. This made things slow and inefficient. Since the site is outside and I had to fill out forms for the nurses my hands needed to work an iPad and write. I’ve always worked with my hands from a young age. I work at a restaurant, so interacting with people and being on my feet and using my hands is not a problem. Enduring the elements was really the hardest part of the job.

Once February came the site started to change. An influx of National Guard (NG) and military reserves began to work on the site. Then a call came the first Monday of February. I was told not to come into work because there will be training for NG to work the scribe and data entry stations. This was the start of a rippling effect on the site, moral, and lack of faith in the public system.

Since I was no longer a scribe my new home was registration. Now keep in mind; because the NG took positions everyone got shifted over on the organizational chart. Everyone who was scribes now registration. Registration to greeter. Greeter to traffic. Once you where let go from traffic your time at the site came to an end.

I worked registration for a solid 4-5 weeks. It was very routine and redundant. I got bored a lot. I always tried to talk to the people in the cars. Some coworkers were hostile and others helpful. It was a good balance of both.

At the end of February and start of March I saw big changes. NG was everywhere and new building where being built. The state has about 6 tents on site. 3 are actively used. Registration was drove out of our tent. So, we were forced to stand in the rain, cold, and wind. Trying to hand people packets of paper in 40 MPH winds is not a fun time. I watched over 20 people quit in 3-4 days. Once we got moved out of the tent, we all realized that our work team had shrunk 4x and we will all be greeters. Some people volunteered and got moved to traffic.

I don’t stare at my phone and I try to be as conscious and aware at work all the time I was given a new task. When everyone became greeters or went to traffic I was pulled aside and given the job of counter by pharmacy. The counter must stop every car as they come down a straight away and find out how many appointments are in each car. Once I have that number on my iPad, I transfer it to a Laptop connected to Pharmacy to let them know how many vaccines should be filed.

My time at the site ended last week. I worked one day. They had me train a NG member how to use the iPad and Laptop for vaccination counting. My moral was shot, and I told my agency I will not be returning. Training someone who is going to take your job the next day was a feeling I never thought I had to experience. It was degrading and made me feel less human. Also, the temp agency had no clue what was going on, plus it was out of their hands.

Now this job was not making or break for me. I work multiple jobs, invest avidly, and stay as active as possible. But I think of all the middle age to older people I worked with over the last few months; Single mothers raising kids, fathers struggling to pay mortgages, and people who were laid off in March of 2020. People are struggling hard, and the government is not the one to help unfortunately. They promised 6-month contacts but terminated nearly everyone within 10-12 weeks. My heart goes out to everyone trying to get by.

This has forever shaped my perspective on all things in the public sector, especially related to healthcare. The government cannot pave roads, but they’ll administer mysterious vaccines. I encourage everyone to read the privacy notices and other forms you were given if vaccinated. If they do not give you an eerie feeling, you are probably sitting on your couch all day cycling MSNBC, CNN, and FOX. I’ve lost all faith in this state and have plans to move to Palm Beach County in September.

I know I am young and dumb, but I can without a doubt say I will never work for the government. I have no trust or energy I want to give to them. Moral of the story is know your worth and don’t trust Uncle Sam. The private sector and decentralization will become way more popular over the next few years. Hope you got your Bitcoin bros, I’ll see y’all on Mars 🚀

\[Side Note\]: Rumors on the site said that NG had transportation, living cost, and other expenses covered as well as weekly bonuses. If this is true, then in no way it would be cheaper for NG to work then civilians.",CoronavirusUS,2021-03-17 11:07:30

Common discussion around results of efficacy trials is that whole rare, some vaccinated subjects were infected with Covid-19; however zero of vaccinated subjects had sever symptoms, we're hospitalized, or died.

Two questions:
1) How are severe symptoms defined? For example, early in the pandemic, non-severe seemed to include anything which didn't require hospitalization but could include fatigue, significant respiratory difficulty, losing taste and smell. Is anything which didn't require medical attention non-severe? What technically requires hospitalization-- seems like that could be broad as well?

2) Are there any significant statistical differences in any data on the general population since we began vaccinating, or do similar results hold true-- that vaccinated individuals

I've been wearing a mask for months while I am visiting them, and wondering if I still need to.

They say the purpose of art is to hold a mirror up to life. So through this mock music video, SNL has held up a mirror to the trend of Baby Boomers basically catching every economic break imaginable, then pulling the ladder up behind them as soon as they could. 

and now when the nation is facing its greatest health crisis in a century, these same people now get top priority for the vaccine, to protect them from a virus many of them don't even believe in, or downplayed to the Nth degree around this time last year.

Right before this, I was eating normally and feeling okay other than my usual anxiety about shots. I had a lot of water before my shot and was still a bit dizzy immediately after getting it, but this happened after my 1st one. Then, only 3 hrs after my shot I started to get a lot of soreness, some pain,  lots of fatigue, and fever. Didn't feel like eating much but forced myself to eat a sandwich and granola bar for dinner. Then I tried to go to bed, but I couldn't. I couldn't sleep because I was having trouble swallowing so badly that I had to put a lot of effort into swallowing just my own spit. I took Benadryl and it didn't help. So I went to the Dr thinking this may be a vaccine reaction, they told me it was not an allergic reaction to the vaccine because it would have been much worse. They said it wasn't asthma, but could be related to my GERD and anxiety (so tired of hearing that everything is due to anxiety). I do have GERD but I have never had it this bad or this suddenly. Then yesterday I slept for the majority of the day, taking Tylenol when needed.  I have only been able to eat yogurt and soup. Even oatmeal made my stomach hurt.  I tried again this morning because I felt better and after eating a sandwich I coughed and it still feels like there is something in my throat. Mind you I did not toast this sandwich. 

Basically my question is,has anyone else experienced swallowing issues or neausea after their shot? I am trying to figure out the source of this. I know it still could be GERD, but I'm not sure how that is the explanation for something that went from 0 to 60 in a few hours.",CoronavirusUS,2021-03-29 12:23:20

I also had no side-effects or reactions other than a slightly sore arm.  The tech administering the vaccine also seemed a bit confused about exactly where she administered the shot.

For reference, other professionals have pointed out that this will be a problem.

Has anyone experienced anything similar? What was the second shot like?,"I received the first shot at the beginning of march (a Friday) and have my second this Friday (April 2nd).

I have allergies, etc. so they ""observed"" me for 30 min. About 20-25 min after I started feeling dizzy and felt like my heart was beating out of my chest. It was dismissed by staff as being anxiety (which is understandable). 

My dizziness didn't go away until around midnight that night, and the elevated heart rate didn't return to normal until sunday. 

I contacted my county health provider and ended up taking to CDC. And I feel like I have gotten conflicted results. 

County listened to my whole story and told me to get it, because not getting it is a bigger risk. CDC initially escalated to an email response, but that was a form email response that didn't really answer my question (but said allergic reaction is rare).  I called CDC again and they advised me not to get it. But this was a call center person, so I still don't know who to listen to. 

I know I should call my doc. But I don't trust him. Long story short, I started seeing him after the virus started. He complains about the virus and drops his mask down in the room with me. I don't feel comfortable with his knowledge.

My real question is: has anyone experienced this, who has also gotten the second shot? Should I expect the symptoms to be the same, or worse, with the second shot?

I was working at a rehab in late January, so I was considered a medical worker and was eligible for the vaccine. I received the first shot on the 28th of January I believe (sometime around then) and was scheduled to receive the second shot a month later. Here's the issue, before I could receive the second shot I switched jobs and no longer work in a medical field, around the time I was supposed to receive the second dose I tried calling the clinic, but they were no help and just told me to talk to my former employer, which I also tried but they told me they couldn't help either and to call the clinic. Basically no one has been much help and eventually I was just being ignored. I'm a 23 year old male who's relatively healthy (other than being a cigarette smoker) so I'm not at a huge risk, except that I do live with my 86 year old grandma who has heart issues. Thankfully she just got her first dose last week so she will soon be fully vaccinated, I on the other hand really don't know what to do. Would trying to find another clinic be a reasonable next step? I understand others are in more need to get their shot before me, but since I already got one, would they be able to give me my second even though I'm technically not ""in the right group yet"" (however you say it). Also, does the first shot wear off if I don't receive the second dose in the appropriate time? It has been ""only"" a little over 2 months, but I don't  want to have the first one go to waste. Should I just call around and explain the situation? I should note also that I left my job not on the best terms, so I'm not sure how willing they'd be to help me if I need them to explain the situation to someone.

An inactivated whole virus was used in ferrets, nonhuman primates and mice. All of the vaccines resulted in protective immunity, but there were complications; the vaccines resulted in an IMMUNE DISEASE in animals. No human studies were done, nor were the vaccine studies taken further because the virus “disappeared.”

These SARS-CoV vaccines all induced antibody and protection against infection with SARS-CoV. However, challenge of mice given any of the vaccines led to occurrence of Th2-type immunopathology suggesting hypersensitivity to SARS-CoV components was induced. Caution in proceeding to application of a SARS-CoV vaccine in humans is indicated.

I live in the Detroit metro area. I was lucky enough to get a vaccine a weekish ago from a FEMA clinic at Ford Field, but the place was packed and turning people away. It was madness.

I also follow a couple online communities for finding COVID vaccines for Detroiters, and I find it absurd that (anecdotally) half of the people who seem to find appointments end up going to mid Michigan or down to northern Ohio for them. I also note that states with the highest vaccination rates tend to have very rural populations (Dakota's, New England, New Mexico...) To me this suggests that our equitible distribution thing is not the correct approach if all we're doing is forcing people from metro areas to rural areas in search of a limited resource, which is abundant there. 

Why not distribute based on demand? 

Do people on other metro areas see a similar trend or is this simple more of Michigan leadership in Lansing trying to pretend Metro Detroit isn't almost half the state's population and over half the state's economic activity?",CoronavirusUS,2021-03-31 10:41:40

For example, could I play basketball with a couple other strangers at the park? Also, does 80% effectiveness mean you have a 20% chance of getting it still, or how does that work?

Further production at the Maryland plant will be delayed.  The incident does not affect Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccines already shipped to states.  But throws into question whether Johnson &amp; Johnson will be able to meet its goal of 100 million doses by  June.  The company barely hit its goal of 20 million doses by the end of March.  The White House is advising states to expect fluctuations in the supply of Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine.  With three companies producing COVID-19 vaccines, government officials assert that Johnson &amp; Johnson delays won't delay the goal of widely-available vaccines by May.  However, the delays may still set back vaccination rates moving into late Spring.

Most of the sites say it’s safe. OBGYN said they cannot comment as they do not have enough data so it’s upto us.

We are leaning towards getting it. All 3 vaccines are available around us and could not decide which one to go with. [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/recommendations/pregnancy.html) website says all are ok. So no clear path to which one should we go with. Any suggestions?

Here is a snippet from CDC:

The Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech vaccines are mRNA vaccines that do not contain the live virus that causes COVID-19 and, therefore, cannot give someone COVID-19. Additionally, mRNA vaccines do not interact with a person’s DNA or cause genetic changes because the mRNA does not enter the nucleus of the cell, which is where our DNA is kept. Learn more about how COVID-19 mRNA vaccines work.

The J&amp;J/Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine is a viral vector vaccine, meaning it uses a modified version of a different virus (the vector) to deliver important instructions to our cells. Viral vector technology has been used by Janssen for other vaccine development programs.  Vaccines that use the same viral vector have been given to pregnant people in all trimesters of pregnancy, including in a large-scale Ebola vaccination trial. No adverse pregnancy-related outcomes, including adverse outcomes that affected the infant, were associated with vaccination in these trials",CoronavirusUS,2021-04-02 10:17:40

During this 2.5 hour meeting, no one wore masks, but they were decently distanced from me and each other. No other precautions were taken that I’m aware of. 

The next day, the employer called to tell me that one of the team members had developed symptoms and tested positive for covid, and he confirmed that I had been exposed to it. He offered to pay for me to get a covid test, which I declined at first, but a couple days have passed and now I have symptoms as well. 

Is there any financial responsibility for this employer who required an in-person interview (twice) for any medical expenses, or were they just offering to pay for a covid test for me purely out of the...kindness of their heart? 

It’s also worth noting that I was laid off 3 weeks ago from another job.

I fully believe in vaccines that have been properly tested and proven to be safe and effective. Most vaccines that we use today have been used for decades and have shown that they are safe even years after receiving them. The covid vaccine, on the other hand, hasn’t had this kind of time to prove its safety. I know health officials insist that it is safe, but what happens if they’re wrong? Medical discoveries happen everyday, so what if they discover it’s not safe? What if in a year people who got the vaccine start suddenly dying? I know this isn’t likely, but it could happen. What’s gonna happen if they find out it can cause lifelong health problems or be deadly after millions of people have already received it? How long will it take before we actually know it’s safe? I want to get the vaccine and do my part of ending the pandemic, but I’m also hesitant. I know some health officials, like my doctor, who are strongly against the vaccine after studying its makeup and the testing performed by its developers.

&gt;Oh so it was 2 weeks now 2 months?  
&gt;  
&gt;So are masks effective or not effective? I'm gonna assume they aren't effective then.  
&gt;  
&gt;So is it safe to be outside in a well ventilated area or not?

Even things from pro maskers like

&gt;Are there permanent symptoms or not and what are the stats?  
&gt;  
&gt;Why did the CDC only require social distancing initially and THEN masks?  
&gt;  
&gt;Does the vaccine fight against the new variant? 

The one fundamental thing that lots of people didn't understand properly is that

**The scientists do not know either.**

And it's driving me insane how absolutely unaware of science these people are. Scientists aren't omniscient, they can't obtain all the possible data on a virus that they had never seen before. Not to mention they have to take sociology, essential workers, economic viability, ***POLITICS***, and personal safety into account as well.

Why is it that all the kinds of articles and reports across the internet are all never concrete? It's always ""we recommend this"" or ""reports say this""? Of course it's not concrete. How the fuck are they supposed to get concrete answers when **proper virus research can take years**? Not to mention they had to present this in a country as unhinged as America, where January 6th demonstrated the ability for Americans to revert us all the way back to 1800.

It's nothing short of a miracle we even managed to produce a vaccine this fast, and even more of a miracle we are distributing it at a high rate. But if a country needed a miracle to save it, then that means it wasn't in a good place to begin with.

The attitude we should have taken was ""better safe than sorry"", not ""it's my opinion to not believe in covid"", and we STILL have to take that attitude now

[https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2777785](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2777785)

Even though we have a vaccine, we DO NOT have concrete answers that suggest the vaccine is 100% as effective against variants, we don't even know if there aren't going to be more variants.

**Be better safe than sorry**. Wear the fucking mask even if you're going on a walk by yourself, don't have that birthday party with your extended family, don't let your child have the Easter Egg hunt with their 2nd grade class, we can EASILY ruin all the progress we have made by deciding ""my opinion deems it safe enough even though there's no way to know for sure"", it resulted in 500k deaths we DON'T NEED ANYMORE.",CoronavirusUS,2021-04-05 18:07:27

I just wanted to stop by here and see if I could get some input on a debate I've been having with myself.  Before this virus hit, I was frequently doing standup comedy, but I stopped because of the pandemic.  I'm getting my second dose of vaccine in a week, which is really exciting, but I'm also having thoughts about when I should return to doing comedy.  A lot of these mics take place in bars or bar-like buildings and that has been widely considered to be one of the most dangerous spot for a virus like this.  Plus, although protected by the vaccine, I haven't seen anything saying I can't still pass the virus on to others even though I am very much protected, and even though I would be at minimum risk I don't want to be all ""forget everyone else, I'm safe.""

Once efficacy wanes, will it be possible to switch brands instead of being stuck on one’s initial choice (for boosters, etc.) for life?","My elderly and at-risk parents received the Moderna vaccine before it was public knowledge that Moderna is 10% less effective in protecting those 65 and older; before it was known that the duration of Moderna’s efficacy may in fact be worrisomely short, particularly for older age groups (https://www.forbes.com/sites/williamhaseltine/2020/12/22/the-moderna-vaccines-antibodies-may-not-last-as-long-as-we-hoped/); and before it was known that Moderna displays a 6-fold drop in efficacy against the South African variant.

As a wealth of positive news about Pfizer has come out over the past week (at least 90% efficacy for all age groups even at the 6 month mark; 100% efficacy against the South African variant; etc.), I have been cursing myself for being the one to help my parents register for a vaccine months ago, and choosing Moderna for them instead of Pfizer.

I’ve found zero scientific literature concerning the possibility, but I’m hoping there are some people here educated enough to know:  when it comes time for boosters and they’ve been adequately developed by both companies, how feasible would it be for a formerly vaccinated Moderna patient to switch over to Pfizer’s lineage?

I’m grateful that my parents are vaccinated for the time being, but the narrative that all vaccines are great and equal is frankly bullshit, and the reality of that is unfolding before us in real time, fairly quickly.

In short, assuming regular boosters and annual shots will be an inevitable and unavoidable part of our lives going forward, are we all damned to whichever vaccine we chose way back when they first became available, before real world comparative studies were completed and presented to the public?

Thank you for any insight - I’m passionate and deeply concerned about this because my parents are my entire life, and if they go I go. Thinking that I may have unknowingly put them at a permanent disadvantage - however slight it might seem to some - is a tremendous weight on my head and heart, and I’m extraordinarily angry that I didn’t have better information on hand before making such a potentially impactful decision.",CoronavirusUS,2021-04-06 11:30:36

I work at a “drive-thru” for Covid testing where we also do bloodwork and give flu shots. My job is to register the patients and confirm their identities and assist the nurses in any way that I can. The building we are located in looks similar to a car wash or where you would get your oil changed. When a car drives up to one of the two bays we operate, we press a button that opens the door for them to drive through. They either come for a Covid test and/or bloodwork (flu shots are extremely rare) and once we finish we open the opposite door to let them leave. 

In my opinion, the drive thru is such a wonderful idea and we get to keep the facility permanently for bloodwork. If anyone has questions feel free to ask away!",CoronavirusUS,2021-04-06 14:59:21

I'm trying to make an appointment at Javits center for example and no matter how quick I am, as soon as I pick a time slot, it says "" time slot no longer available"". Every location I try is saying the same thing.

&amp;#x200B;

Does anyone have advice? I am literally losing my mind on why it's so damn hard making an appointment.",CoronavirusUS,2021-04-06 20:07:18

I've been out of work now 6 months, so as much as I questioned why they would have me come in for a under 2-minute ""interview"" in person to basically tell me they don't read resume's (they literally only asked about my recent experience), I still went.  I should have know from the obvious red flags that this is a waste of time and potential threat to my life since every other interview I've had has been remote.  Turns out, they booked 8 of us for the same time for the interview.  Hours would be usual 9-5, but the interviewer, was somehow still late to work and showed up at 10:15 to the office for their 10:00 interviews x 8.  Meanwhile, the 8 of us did our best to social distance in a waiting area maybe 8ft x 15ft.  One guy even drove from Orlando to Miami to be at this shit-show.  While there, not a single employee was seen wearing a mask.  Not a single bottle of sanitizer was seen by any of us.  We had to fill out additional paperwork beforehand, and were only given 1 pen.

The best part of all this, is the potential job can be done fully remotely, and has been by thousands, including myself, for over 10 years.

Additionally, myself, and the other 7 gentlemen waiting for the pre-interview, all had a significant grey-hair percentage, so I'll risk saying we have all been in the industry for a while.  Yet we all agreed we were intrigued by the huge range in potential salary and extra vague job description.  Upon pre-interview, we were told it was for basically a junior position, despite what pay and their candidate selection indicated.  They seem to want entry level people with a decade or more experience.  Not to mention the grey presence would stereo-typically mean we are all likely at least slightly increased risk for COVID  than some 22 yr old college grad looking for entry level work.

If the other job candidates weren't as visibly nervous about our cramped situation, I would have just walked out.  I was 2nd in the room, so by the time the last arrived I was kind of committed.  The first guy and I kept shooting each other increasingly nervous looks when more people came in.  For 2 or 3, the space was fine.  By the end we were all just plastered on the walls as far as we could be from each other, comfort be damned.

This company was also the first company I've applied to in about 15 years that actually asked for a printed list of references, a printed resume, and printed paper copies of my diploma and later industry certifications.  It is an IT industry, seems to me they can handle online applications and, at most, emailing of these documents, but apparently I am wrong.  Seems to me this could be done by any of a dozen remote meetings deals, Teams, Zoom, cups-and-strings, smoke-signals, Webex (in that order) instead of dragging us to their shitty office in the middle of a light industrial complex to simply hand  in paperwork and  answer a couple questions for screening purposes.",CoronavirusUS,2021-04-07 04:17:54

You can also request a notification for any location listed and get a text message with a link as soon as we see any availability there, in the hopes that you'll be able to jump on it. This started in MA because that's where I happen to live (the original post there: https://www.reddit.com/r/CoronavirusMa/comments/m2aobv/findvaxus_check_vaccine_availability_and_get_text/), and once I got CVS reliably working I opened it up to the other states, so they're mostly just CVSes right now, but I'm working on adding more.

The main focus here is speed, so we can get an SMS to you as quickly as possible when we find available locations, which is currently an average of about 8 seconds (depending on the number of locations in your state).

It's still a work in progress, I'm constantly adding more locations and trying to make the website better, so feedback is extremely welcome! If you manage to get an appointment using the site, please let me know! I'd love to hear if this thing actually helps people out. Likewise if you have any issues, please tell me so I can get it fixed.

Obligatory disclaimers: I'm not associated with any government or any company/organization running these locations or other websites. I just know how to make this stuff and figured I could put that to some good use. When you request notifications, I only store the given phone number along with the id of the location you're looking for, and once I send a notification, that gets *deleted*. No ads, no tracking, not trying to get anything out of this except shots in peoples' arms!

I’m a Florida resident visiting for four weeks with my wife. 

We’re only married in Spain - ie, a marriage that is not legally recognized in the States. 

When I got Moderna at Winn Dixie in Jacksonville Florida, they needed my SSN (only because I didn’t have insurance) but otherwise didn’t check my ID. I know no less than 13 friends who have been vaccinated all over Jacksonville without showing ID. 

Anyone have luck / info on EU citizens getting vaccinated in Florida (or southern Georgia)?

FWIW, not trying to rip off the government/get something for nothing. But since vaccines are easy to get right now - at least here - and since Spain isn’t vaccinating people our age or with our preferred vaccine right now - figured it’s not the worst idea to get vaccinated here. 

Looking at Pfizer or Moderna but J&amp;J isn’t off the table. 

Any advice welcome - 

Thanks!

But I couldnt understand why my vision was still dizzy and my balance was off from a stomach virus and why it was still going on after the virus went away. After doing some research it turns out this is actually from the vaccine. Is anyone else going through the same thing? Has it went away yet? Im nervous that this is permanent but I feel as though if people can face facial paralysis and recover then I shouldnt have too much to worry about and I may have to just wait it out.,CoronavirusUS,2021-04-08 09:37:18

Yay! I'm now protected!   :)  That euphoria lasted less than 10 seconds because I made the stupid mistake of chatting with my hot pharmacist.

What she told me during the next 5 minutes made me very depressed. 

Apparently my local vaccination sites are practically empty all the time(Walgreens, hospital, county health dept, etc).  She said her pharmacy, located in a very busy part of town, rarely gave out more than 30 to 40 vaccines per day.   They even put up a new giant sign that said ""Free COVID-19 Vaccines Today! Walk-ins Welcome!"".... but they get only a couple of walk-ins per day during the last 2 weeks. 

Does that mean I live in a town where people don't give a rat's [rear end]?   Actually, I already know the answer because she told me...   :(   Based on her own experience, she said she would be surprised if more than 20% of the town's population got the vaccinations as of this week.  She said if she had to guess, at least 40 to 50% of the town's people would NEVER get vaccinated, unless their work, school or travel demands it.  :(
